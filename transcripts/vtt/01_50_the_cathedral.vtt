Do you have a

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
resolution.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
don't have a resolution should I do is there something you'd like me to do now is just asking for

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
your your relationship with yourself. My relationship to myself is so thoroughly broken. I've given

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
up

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
introspection three cause you are my resolution. Sure to does a scene if you're of no more

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
seething resentments. Wow Got no fight with somebody in a

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
restaurant they were yelling curse

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
words and I was having dinner with like my dad or my sisters they were yelling curse words and normally would

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
have seeds in resentment say whatever and said hey this is a small restaurant

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
yelling curse words and that could you please stop and when they

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
did they said OK and then they muttered a bunch of things about me like on here.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Did you resent see the resentment subside. Yeah. Ha. Interesting.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
OK So we are not here to talk about her new year's resolutions that we

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
have we're here because through the Panama. He has a story for us.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Yes I do your job you tell people is about.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Yes please start it.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So this is a story about a family and this huge thing happened to the family and it puts them into

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
a situation where they have no control a They've got options but they're not real

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
options and the way they decide to deal with it is to invite the entire

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
world into this very personal problem they have and when you

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
first told me about it it sounded like unfathomable to me like you did not it didn't make

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
sense so you went to find out what was going on.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Yes. So let me start by introducing you to

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
couple a new green cars and Ryan Green. Oh yes

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I know I really need those I think that's

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
why I'm suffering this morning because

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I live

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
in a small house in Loveland Colorado chatting online got

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
married turned twenty one they moved into this house the very next

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
day they had their first son Caleb their second son

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Isaac was a computer programmer and Amy took care of the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
kids they were just living in a mess of diapers and toys church every

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Sunday and then in two thousand and nine they had

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Joel

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.000
was

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
born the other

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
day if I was twenty five when he was four and then Isaac was four and I would've been like

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
twenty seven yeah I think I was twenty eight I was twenty one July figured

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
out things were going fine and then right around Joel's first birthday.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
He started to throw up a lot and Amy and Ryan noticed he was tilting his head

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
to one side the doctor did a bunch of tests and found a tumor in his brain

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
a particularly rare and aggressive kind called

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and so when you have an eighty or

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
eighty. You'll go

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
through all the most intense chemotherapy and all the most intense radiation they throw

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
the kitchen sink at it and doing that you have about a fifty percent chance of

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
surviving for five years.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I double checked this and it turns out the odds of survival are even grimmer it's

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
a fifty percent chance of surviving just two

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
years when you hear this kind of news. Is there any part of you that's like what if

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
you don't do the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
treatment sure I remember before his

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
first surgery asking them a lot about like really have to have she was therapy and to you know myself because I can't

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
do that like maybe it would be better for him to just die now because I don't think

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
that I can like put my kids through

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
chemotherapy for years but then as time wore on and by the time we actually even heard about the

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
the tumor. Then you're just thinking like oh well fifty percent like that's half

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
like we've got a good shot that he gets through

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
this with what do you think

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I have to say he's excusing the awful so they're taking care

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
of him. This

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
is from a home video. Joel's brothers meeting him in the hospital. Isaac

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
is two and a half looking kind of scared.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Joel is a little over a year old he's lying in a small red wagon hooked up to

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
an I.V. one of his eyes is turned and just a little Doctors may have nicked a nerve. When

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
they removed his tumor too skinny and his head is perfectly round his

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
food his food goes to that too

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
yeah Joe went through ten months of intense treatment.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Amy and Ryan spent six seven eight hours a day holding Joel in a hospital

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
bed while he got

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
chemo and then his parents spent nights feeding him through an

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
I.V. And so it be like

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
this our pump and he would be this like this a white milky

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
substance that would provide all of his nutrition because he couldn't swallow very

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
well even the sweet moments were sometimes hard to enjoy.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
One day it was a nice shaft. She was holding

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Joel by with sitting in his room with him and I've seen him a

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
song and clapping and he was clapping his hands and he was

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
sort of like babble singing along and so like for me it was just one of those moments that you felt

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
like I'm always going to remember this like sometimes you just have a moment and you go I'm going to remember this the rest of my

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
life and then that made me sad because I thought oh like that the reason I think I'll

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
remember those the rest of my life is because he could

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
die until eventually I did just kind of decide like

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I think I need to be all in like I think I need to love him like mad and I think we need to live our

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
lives like he's going to live.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
That's what they did for a year and then in November two thousand and ten just

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
before Joel second birthday.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
The doctors called the men and said we're really sorry Joe has a new tumor

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and there's nothing we can do now to cure him best we can do is radiate the tumor ease his

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
pain and this should have been the end of the story but it

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
wasn't there was this one night that Ryan says was the worst night

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and all of Joel's on this Joe had a stomach bug. He was throwing up got the hydrated.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So Ryan spent the night with him in the

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
hospital and just remember him really wanting apple

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
juice as one of his favorite things at the hospital but then I'd give it to me just throw it up

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
again I wanted to give him just because that's what he wanted but. I knew if I gave it to

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
him then it would be you know it hurt

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
him and he's crying and crying and his cries just get more frantic

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and animal and there's nothing that Ryan can

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
do like the into the night. You know just such sunken eyes but I just remember like I

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
wanted to hold him and I couldn't put him down because he would get so

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
upset and when Brian finally did put him down. Joel would start hitting his

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
head against the wall of his crib Eventually Brian himself started to lose it. He was

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
crying too. And then in the early hours of the morning he lay down and

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
prayed and I remember that's when he stopped crying and he fell

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
asleep.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And it was just one of those.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
This moves few moments in life where like it felt like an answer from God.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And it wasn't like I heard a voice or saw you know a burning

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
glass or anything like that but it was just it felt so much like

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Mercy and beyond just sheer relief. Ryan had this

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
other thought frankly a weird thought.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
This whole ordeal reminded him of a video game like you have to get

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
the baby to stop crying so you keep trying things give him juice bounce him talk to him but the

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
weird thing is in this awful game. None of those things actually work.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
They're all like fake choices.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Ryan thought

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
what if I could make a game like this where you the player you don't really

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
have control.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Can

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I bring you to that place the place that I'm in right

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
now I want to show you what it feels like to feel helpless

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
but to have received praise. I felt like it would be

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
ultimately kerching to

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
people

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I remember she really was like I want to make a game about that day that she was dehydrated in the hospital

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
thinks that's terrible. That's not a game and no I don't want to play that like to think that that word

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
game like something you do in your leisure time you know and so who wants to

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
spend their leisure

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
time reliving the worst moment of a man's life so I said Do not make that that

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.000
is

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
horrible but he clung to that idea so finally Amy said OK I'll give you

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.000
three

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
months he teamed up with two other people an indie game designer a sound designer he raided

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
his savings and together they built a prototype.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So a few months later. It's the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Alongside Assassin's Creed

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
thirty battlefield for the new. Thrift V.R. headset.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
There was

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Ryan My name is

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Ryan about a personal game that I'm making my same Joe had

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
just one year old brain.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Ryan is standing in front of a bunch of young tech dude. They're listening kind

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
of

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
halfheartedly you'll lose a lot of in-fighting has a neighbor or doctors fight for him

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000
or family fights or to serve a God that's the God of the living.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Amy stayed home fretting because they were almost out of money and she was worried

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
that Ryan would come home feeling

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
crushed but that's not what happened. Ryan got back

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
said it was amazing this person introduced me to

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
that person when there's two or three different people who want to fund

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
my game.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
It really blew my mind because I'm still dislike because of Georgie hydration game that I told you

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
to never make and he realizes like you've never played it like you've never played the scene.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Amy puts on the headphones. And finds herself back in

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.000
the hospital

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
room. You're playing Brian.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
He looks like he's made out of our economy. You don't see Joe you see an empty crib

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and you can hear him crying. You can move your mouse around the screen and

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
options appear you can walk around the room give him

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
juice bounce him

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
but no matter what you do his crying just gets worse

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and worse. I hold you.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:47.000
After

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:47.000
five

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
or six minutes with us Brian sits in a chair and drops his head into a flask

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
prays. As a player you can't

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
control when it starts the prayer just happy. After a

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:17.000
while

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.000
was

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:36.000
like.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
OK

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
this

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:51.000
cancer.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Coming

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
up after the break might be the world's biggest design

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:15.000
problem

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.000
space

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.000
is

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
the

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
easiest way to create a beautiful website blog or

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
online templates and twenty four seventh's

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
support is where I post all my

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
gripes or at least I would if I didn't find it so difficult

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
to kind of puts me in a really dark hair

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
a lot of what's joyful about my grabbing you notice

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.000
the

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
world runs around the world like everything's so beautiful I want

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
to write a poem about it and you run around the world

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and sometimes I

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
feel like my grades are genuinely like a caged animal who has no power in the. Just

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
as to be yelling which animals that I know a

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
gopher go for cripes icons

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
logical and so on P.J. suggestion I made the website go for grapes dot com

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
slash Goldman if you go there you can submit your own rights. And if your grades are really good not only will we add

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
them to the website but we will read them in an upcoming series

laugh.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
My co-host P.J. vote loves comedy talks about it all the time so

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
he decided to choose something that he really likes they have a new web series by the people who started the pages

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Welcome

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
back to the show before the break. Ryan and Amy decided to develop a video

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
game about their son's battle with cancer and they named it that dragon cancer.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
The title is a little misleading. This is not a game where you go out and slay dragons.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Instead it's a series of immersive

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
vignettes the first scene is at the pond you start off as a

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
duck you paddle towards a little boy it's Joel or

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
this origami version of him he doesn't have eyes or a mouth but he has a voice.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And that is actually Joel's laugh as you hand them pieces of bread and he throws

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
them into the water.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
You know you throw. Aside

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
life. The kid speaking here is I sick. Jill's

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
brother but he can't

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
talk to you

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
to

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
talk like you know you can

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
all. Still got sick right after he turns one

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
you have a part of the album that

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
you explore the most

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
kids. And there's other vignettes like there's one time. In a

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
hospital when to keep Joe entertained. Ryan blew up surgical gloves like

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
balloons. It's this gorgeous scene where you see Joel floating into the nighttime

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
sky towards the moon holding on to these surgical

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
balloons and then you see

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
these blackbirds appear from the corner. That's the cancer and it

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
pops the balloons one by

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
one or there's another scene where you're

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
in the hospital. You're sitting with Joel in a little red wagon and the two of you are riding down the

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
hall was all there glowing in blue green yellow.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And the goal is to collect all the chemo chemicals they look like little jabs and you move

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
the controller to grab

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
them. And throughout the scenes

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
you play many games you discover rooms listen to voice mails from

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Amy there's even little levels. Beat but the

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
cancer is always around the edges of this world thorny and

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
black and creeping in no matter how well you do you will

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
always follow the course of Joel's

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
illness and at one point you'll

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
arrive here.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
The waiting room where doctors tell him Ian Ryan the joy of cancer is

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
terminal as they break the news rain starts pouring into the

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
room and Ryan slowly starts to slip under the

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
water

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
usual suspects but already on the Talk Back on how we

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
can talk about how to train

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:51.000
and

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
play

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:03.000
with life.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
This is a moment where words like play and game are a

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.000
pretty

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
tough fit. It's certainly not

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
fine but for Ryan and Amy these

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
heavy scenes are worth

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
it because they contain these other moments that they've been lucky to experience

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
with their boys like there's a scene where you blow bubbles for Jol and he keeps

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
asking for more and more.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.000
And

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
there was kind of for me this beautiful picture of what it was like to have a child that was sick because he would

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
think to yourself oh how would you in he think I could just to be able to play with him and

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
hear him laugh. I would blow him bubbles

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
for days.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
So

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
they worked on the game for months. Joel who everyone said would die after four months he

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
was alive and well the palliative radiation killed his tumor and. The next one

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
on the next. Amy started calling it the cancer that cried

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
wolf Jol hit all these

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
milestones that Ryan and Amy have taught themselves not to expect he turned to one

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
house and said his first word he learned to

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
swallow and eat normal

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
food. He turned three and took his first

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.000
steps

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
he just became this miracle baby fifty Amy

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
says that somebody in their church said they had a vision and a vision that Joel

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
would do great things.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
So anyway. Things are going well two filmmakers called and asked if they could

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
follow riden Amy

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
around make a documentary about making this

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
game. So there's all this video footage around the

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
game's creation.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
So here's Ryan at this computer on a design edit he's talking to

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Josh his partner on the game.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
We're just go.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Yes Josh starts playing peek a boo with

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Joel again and.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
So you've got Ryan designing a game about Joel who's sitting on his lap the whole

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
time you've got his wife who's helping write scenes in the game and she's acting in

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
it and now they also have six other people on the team developers three D. artists a sound designer.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
I've sat in on some of their design meetings they all happen on Google Hangouts you know like my

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
character always shouts.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And I feel like maybe a little bit better you're going to this

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
because I feel like it because Brian always direct my

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
audio and so you know Ellie. You're just all like

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
well I'm

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
like. I'm blaming

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
the directing your bad

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
director for three years the routine was the

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
same get a tear it would go away. Joe would get a

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
to go way this happened fifteen times. And

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
then this routine breaks the doctors tell them to

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Murs that they cannot

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000
treat us that the tumors that were there.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
One was in a field we had already radiated and you cannot continue to radiate an area too much or it

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
can cause brain death and it was right brain

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
stem received the most radiation

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
before for the first time was not an

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
option but Amy and Ryan knew

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
that this couldn't be

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
and this is the cancer the crisis will be found in experimental drug

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
trial in San Francisco and they decided to go. They packed up their whole

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
family four boys including Joel and drove the twelve hundred miles. They lived

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
in San Francisco for two whole

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
months and the treatment. It didn't work.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Stop

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
swallowing he stopped walking and eventually he needed an oxygen tank to keep breathing.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
So in March they drove back home to

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Loveland the first night we drove around the car like he was

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
it wasn't doing well enough of going in the

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
car after an hour of driving around. We tried to get chill out. And he kept

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
saying go because a family will tell you to go as you please and he chick is headed please go

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
go hard as he didn't wanna get out of the car. So you were like well maybe we should just drive

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
you around for the next few days.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:44.000
A

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
few days later. Amy and Ryan invite everyone they know to their home.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
We had a prayer night just praying for him to be healed everyone

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
over here we spent hours just worshiping and

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
prayed. There's video footage of this night. Living room.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
There's family members friends people from their church community wryness holding Joel and

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.000
they're

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
praying all we have is the hero was always.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
The only hope we have is your service.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:24.000
So why would hope all I have that might disappoint me.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.000
But

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
I hope.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
The.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.000
What's

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
your strongest

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:55.000
memory. I think is just realizing that he's gone.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
And I don't know it's the it's

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
that space of being with a bunch of people that desperately want the same

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
thing that you are crying out

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000
for that grace and mercy trying to fit invade a situation.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Joe died later that night it was March thirteenth two thousand and

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
fourteen. And even though he'd been terminal for more than three years.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Amy said that at that moment she was completely unprepared.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
I feel like in a way because we were believing that he would be healed and because we were believing that even if he

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
died maybe should be raised from the dead like which is mild You said that your story because it's

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
weird and I so get that it's weird of

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
us because we still believe that he could live.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
I feel like we didn't go through all the processes of getting ready for him to die

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
the way that maybe you would if you were certain that this was it.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
And so the next several weeks are just terrible she. You

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
know what they did this

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
for she's just trying to pick up the pieces they have to organize a memorial

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
service

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
funeral and then at some point people are sending her these grief

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
books people send you a bunch of grief books after your child dies and like you look at them but you also

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
kind of just don't like because you don't care of your grief is like anyone else's and you don't care what you're supposed to

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
be feeling but I kind of was like something through them and one thing I read talked about that grief

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
is all of the feelings you have and morning is what you create out of those

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
feelings or what you do with

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
them

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
and so she realizes that the game is. Now it's

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
become their

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
morning we had money set aside like

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
a grave marker to stone. I finally thought you know

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
like the gravestone supposed to be the memorial for him to like you're making his memorial So like

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
let's take this money we've set aside for this and use it to

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
build the game and win the game instead we could always go

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
back and do the gravestone but just like I love that we're doing this like

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.000
I

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
love that we're putting everything we have in to this game and it feels

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
like children's service like it deserves to have everything from us all

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
of our emotion all of our investment. All of our money like I'm sort

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
of glad that it cost us

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000
everything

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
and this brings us to the

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
cathedral Rhein decides that the only way to capture those

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
final months of Joel's life and his death is by setting it all in a

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
cathedral and not just any cathedral. This will be the place that contains all of their

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
feelings about losing

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Joel and for the player. It would be the climax of the game.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
So when you walk into the cathedral in this narrow

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
hallway with faulty ceilings all the stone is white

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
inside it almost looks like

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
it was carved from a single piece of rock the whole way. They go in and now the

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
ceiling soars up above

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
you the cathedral is full of light and you're heading towards the light as you move

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
though you realize that you're walking very slowly because the cathedral is so

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
large and you immediately have this feeling of being in a holy place

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
but Ryan also wanted to represent the human body. Joel's body. So

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000
the pillars twist and turn like

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
rips a curve as they rise up into the ceiling and look up into the ceiling

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
you see that there is carvings of

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
of flora and these stone flowers that are in bedded in the

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
ceiling almost like a garden. I wanted the cathedral to feel alive or

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
full of life but also frozen.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
But here's the thing to Ryan. This doesn't totally describe those last months

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
with

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Joel when you fight cancer. You're burning cells. You

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
are poisoning the body your doing all these things to kill something

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
you do all this damage in our quest to like seek life.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
The cathedral has to show that damage. So Ryan removed all of that heavenly light and

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
he snake these neon tubes along the floor the

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
tube started and so this idea of all the different things that we had hooked up to all throughout his

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
whole illness. Whether it be any tradition or humor

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
therapy or

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
antibiotics and he just kept going until the player is bathed in yon

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
light in a sense turned into this neon

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
I club. I mean there's this there's this sense. I have

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
the neon crosses and there's the cross up on the altar is

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
like wrapped in a vine of the year and there's there's neon

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
vines like crawling the pillars to the left and to the right.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
He's trying to say like these are the unnatural things that we do you in order to stay

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
alive.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
But the Cross says Amy didn't like them. This fall. So Ryan removed

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
them and then he had the

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
thought we have all these cubes and things for chemo but I want to put

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
in the machines that were

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
keeping Joe alive and so he starts building

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
equipment very loud almost steampunk type

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
contraptions that you would press a button to keep him

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
going the user would have to like fiddle with the levers

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
and make things just right so that that Scholz getting what he needs to stay

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
alive and we kind of leaned into that. Even more because

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
there's the scaffolding and there's this huge stained glass. Depiction of showing

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
us that wasn't done

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
yet and so you would climb the scaffolding and you put in a piece of

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
glass but then you would look down and you see the indicator for his

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
oxygen and he was running low so you'd run back down the scaffolding and you want to

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
like change the dials or

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
press the button that and then run back up the stuffing.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
But then after months of building these machines.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
He gets rid of them.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Why do you decide to take out the machines done. Like why does that whole section go.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
So I think I want people to feel like you could kill

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
jaw like that it was their fault that he

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
died and they think you know what this is

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
all this is all a little more of

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
it and so on the right side of the cathedral I replaced the oxygen

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
tank with this huge installation of an

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:37.000
amusement

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
park an amusement park inside the cathedral. Because during those last two

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
months in San Francisco the family had loved going to Disneyland. So for

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
starters I had this shooting

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
gallery can actually shoot the target.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Yeah you can shoot a target like you can pick up. You can pick up these little rifles

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
tethered to the

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
stand and you aim at these

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
chickens. She's the animals and they turn into fried

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
chicken but after months and months of work. Brian decides this

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
amusement park is distracting from the bigger idea of this final weeks which is asking

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:22.000
God for mercy. So he scrapped the entire park.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Brian

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:23.000
has

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
been stuck inside this cathedral. He spent a year on it drawing and redrawing

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
the final weeks of his son's life. Hundreds of drafts in the

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
most recent version. There are these prayer

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
candles

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:56.000
and every time you light one you hear a prayer from the night of Joel's death.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.000
I've

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
spoken to Ryan several times during this whole process. Sometimes he

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
sounds defeated but other times happy and upbeat and whenever he

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:05.000
thinks

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
he finally has it. He shows it to Amy who looks at it and

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
says I don't think that's right and it's been hard I think for both of us to get to a place

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.000
where

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
we say. It can say all the things the kids' future all can say all the things we

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
want to say I just had to cut something else in the game because we can finish it and it's hard

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
to be just one and never finish it and make it as beautiful as

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
possible and I don't know like there's a part of me feels like we betrayed the project by

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000
finishing it.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
But of course they have to finish it. There's investors. There's a release

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
date and the thing as the longer Ryan works on this cathedral. The

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
further away it's all

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
gaps. What's disappointing to me is how quickly it

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
fades jolts the memories

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
and person of Joel fades because

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
he becomes more and more an idea.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
This game is not him. It's just an echo of him it's not funny even the best.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Echo of him.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
I think that's the thing I'm struggling with as we as we're approaching the end of

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
this the good I do all this for why why is

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
it that

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
the game is coming out mid

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
January the cathedral is magnificent but to Ryan it will always

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
be

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
unfinished

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
sure.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Ryan

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
was able to finish the place that comes right after the cathedral. It's the scene where

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
you say goodbye to

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
chill you find yourself in a boat next to Joel. There's no

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
or. You're headed towards an

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
island you get there. You walk along a small

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000
path and you end up in a clearing in the woods.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.000
There's a picnic

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
blanket sitting on

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:18.000
it

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
and around him are all the things he loved

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
about

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
a huge stack of pancakes way way bigger than him a little

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
dog

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:31.000
and

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:49.000
bubble

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:49.000
gum

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
ball for as long as

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
you're

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.000
OK.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.000
And

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.000
you

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
just

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:22.000
keep

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:22.000
blowing

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000
bubbles

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
and at some point you just walk away if I

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
can

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:55.000
talk
