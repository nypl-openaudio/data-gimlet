about relationships love sex and everything in between some of the material and language in

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:23.000
this episode.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Experiences

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
many of us have in our journey through the world of

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
dramatic can't think of anything

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
but

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
love and nothing illustrates this better than reading a love letter written by

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.000
a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
teenager or better yet having an adult read

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
a love letter he wrote as an who couldn't be with his

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
words woman of his dreams. So this first

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
group called Grown up. They wrote

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and what you're about to hear is a grown up. Dave reading a

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
letter his seventeen year

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
old Alfred to a girl he spent two summers with at camp. In front of a live audience.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Dear Julia before I begin I want to know that nothing you've done brought on what I'm about to say it's obvious by

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
now that you know how much I love and care for you I don't even know exactly what it is that brought on this

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
crazy adoration for you but whatever it was it worked. This is a one of those love letters more

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
of a way for me to be able to live my life normally rather than always upset and crying because I

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
can't be with the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
kids I love you I love absolute everything about you I love your smile

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
love your eyes the love hugging you I love your sense of humor. I love how you deal with problems by saying fuck it I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
mean I love your nose.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Ears eyes and mouth. I really can't get enough of you this letter so far might seem will too

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
intense

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
but my only way of relieving his passion that it had inside me for three years now when you

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and I hooked up after going to the peel pub. It was the happiest moments in all my

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
life. The night before when I couldn't get it

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
out the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
night before when I couldn't get up it wasn't because I was tired and stoned. It was because I was so happy and in love that I

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
was thinking that I was even thing about sex.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I was thinking that I was kissing you that's really all I need to be happy when

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
we're there is has the second night I was holding you in my arms and we were sitting on the floor there was

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
a point while fooling around that I opened my eyes and looked up to you and I swear I could have started crying

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
right there

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
because it was me holding you that night I told you Jeff was coming to pick me up that

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
was a lie. I lied because I was so happy after being with you that walking home from stairs was

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
nothing I practically skipped

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
tone and God knows I live far from

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
her first

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I decided that the only way for me to be relaxed about us was to not call you and hope that eventually I would

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
get over you but I value our friends. More than any one of my best friends and I can not talk to you.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I'm also having very mixed feelings about you and other

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
guys

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
here because I know we're not together and I know there

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
will always be other guys but when I picture you with someone else I get butterflies in my stomach like you want when you want

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
to stay with Mike for the football game. I can hardly sleep until I smoked a joint to forget about

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
everything

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
because I knew you were going to hook up with him but what if you

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
know. I've never felt like this this way about anyone in

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
my entire life. You're the shit in my world. It's not going anywhere. I love you more than anything and I can't

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
stop typing because I don't think I could ever truly show you how I feel but I think there's a

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
satisfactory job.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.000
JULIA.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I love you in every sense of the word and I really don't think anyone could ever love me the way. I do if any guy you

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
ever date later puts you down or pisses you off. Don't stay with him because of PICK ME UP know the nicest

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
sweetest cool and most beautiful girl in the world is being treated like shit my number seventy five

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
natural.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Remember cliche because anytime in life you need a lover someone to care for you call because I want you to know I

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
always will. I can't write anymore because I can't stand thinking about you just

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
no big bull that David Keystone doesn't always will love Julia.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
P.S. I didn't write his letter to upset you in any way shape or form. I just had to let you know how I

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000
feel I'm sore for making it so personal but that's what true love will do to a person.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I mean I have to be honest with you guys. The thing about Dave's

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
letter is it reminds me

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
of a lot of things that I wrote on my Live Journal not so nice cool.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Which is actually even more embarrassing because Live Journal just like open and all

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
your friends can.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So it's not just like a gave myself the dignity of just like a writing these like long

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
angsty reflections and then just sending them to one. Or Sen. No I posted mine on the

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Internet for everyone that I knew and went to school with to see.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So eventually I grew out of the letter writing phase are you know I guess

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
angsty Live Journal posting phase and they did too you know which is why he was able

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
to be a grown up that was reading a letter that he wrote as a kid I hope actually that he gets out of

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that but you know we all moved into adult dating which

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
is I mean I've had some I've had some moments of good luck with dating as

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
an adult but I would say that most of it has been pretty terrible and you know it's one of those

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
things where it's like some people are out there looking for the person that they want to spend the rest of their life

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
with and other people like myself are just looking for somebody tall good looking with central

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
air to hang out with during the summer time. It's just it's kind of just this mess of

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
like consistently unmet expectations.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
The other thing is I guess to kind of throw a wrench into the whole operation. There's no real way to meet new

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
people as an adult you know I mean people at summer camp like Dave no longer meeting people

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.000
at

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
school after a while you run out of new people to meet through work if you're anything like me you've dated

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
all of your friends friends. So you know what do you do when you've dated everyone that you know.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And that's a really big question so I figured who better to ask about how to find your

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
person than our Head of people

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
operations. Katie Christensen Hi Britney. Hi Katie welcome to the show. Thank you the

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
head of people operations is a rather started be a nebulous title. Please for our

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
listeners at home who may not know what that means. What do you

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
do my job is basically to make sure that we are attracting

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and recruiting

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and hiring the best possible people to come market gimlet and then also once people

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
are at Gimblet to make sure that they feel like this is the absolute best place in

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
the world to

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
work. So are you currently involved attached. I am. How did you

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
meet this person so lucky fellow this lucky fellow Jim and I have been together for about a

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
year and we met

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
on. The World Wide Web on OK Cupid you know honestly I'm

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
a big believer in OK I don't believe in meeting people in real life that I just don't

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
like I want to know I like I want to see like can you write Are

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
you interesting.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Are you funny. Do you have weird perspectives on thing. Sometimes I like to do a little bit of

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
like prescreening all over pre-work I am so glad you brought that up. It's totally in

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
line with our next clip that comes to us from a show called Star talk radio

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
that's hosted by astrophysicist Neil de Grasse Tyson who gets for this episode

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
is this love researcher Helen Fisher she is a biological

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
anthropologist and she's also a senior researcher at the Kinsey Institute.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
She also happens to be a scientific advisor to Match dot

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
com So Dr Fisher is talking about online dating with Neil de Grasse

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Tyson and his co-host for this episode comedian Chuck

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Nice if you go on these dating sites. It does require some work. You know first of all lower your

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
standards when in doubt lower your standards right you're giving up you know I'm telling you I think

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
of reasons to say

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
as he was a huge part of the brain that enables us to overlook the negative in Focus on the

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
positive all the time but one of the problems when you're meeting people online is you know so little about them when

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
you start out that you overweight those few things that you know the more you get to

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
know somebody the more you like them. You've got to give people a chance. You

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
know you know that is a chemical thing because and I know I'm probably going

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
to get in trouble if I say this. I'm the same you can edit this track

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Ok here is the truth. I have often that and said

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
to myself why after I had eighteen years of

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
marriage to stop it or OK I will protect shock from still

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
going to put enough the you

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
know back away from the microphone.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
If I were to put it down on paper. You know I should not be in. Love.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Yeah I should not even really I should not be woman I love her to

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
death and there's nothing she can do that's

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
wrong and if I were to actually go and see all the stuff that. I

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
probably would be like No I don't like that no I don't go. So if you if you

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
know you deconstruct as I grew a shock not

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
related to nothing there but in total it's working for you my God it's the best thing ever happened to me. So how

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.000
him

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
since we've got a guy. We have to

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
defeat talk your lying to yourself where you are now I know here you are also a lot

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
in love with your wife. However always looking the negative and that huge part of the brain that enables you to do

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that and bless it.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
So if you do have a list of what you like in someone and then you put it on one of these websites

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and then you find someone that matches it. The premises. That's your that's your soulmate.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
But what Chuck is saying is if you laid out the

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
inventory then. No he would never met her in this room. I

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
would have never met her that's what I

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
read Larry are really know you wouldn't matter but one would never meet her there are things

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
about that woman that you really like that going deep into you

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.000
love

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
map and what of these websites. There are matching people up. And slicing and dicing

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
them the bottom line is these are not dating services these are introducing services. The

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
only true algorithm is your own human brain. So the faster you can get out and meet the guy or

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
girl in the bars the way the street you know is just giving you a whole range of

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
people and then you gotta do the job and that's what's really really

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
would you agree that if you preprocess if you proscribe.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
What you think you're going to be attracted to that is greatly restricting your

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
options who probably you could meet had least twenty thirty a potential for that you're right. Listen

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
staying at home and looking for somebody on the couch is certainly going to not do much for your

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
options. So Katie I have found through

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
both dating and hiring and recruiting people watch our show. Shockingly similar process.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I always thought they were. Speak more I thought they were similar. So I have

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
learned that there are some people out there who are programmed and hard

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
wired to only want to see what they want to see in other people so they look at

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
either resume or they see a an online dating profile and they're like this person's amazing this person

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
did all these cool things this person can write in complete sentences Oh my God this is like amazing.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000
But you willingly ignore any sort of red flag until it's.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Slammed into your face too late and then there are some people who are I think just

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
naturally skeptical of any sort of process like that so whether it's online dating

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and I don't know this like profiles kind of grows

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
like he were red shirted his picture and like guys that were red shirts or just like

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Bowl or you know. And I say well it's like you know you can get a complete

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
picture of anybody from any piece of paper from the screen and so I really like her

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
advice about just going out and kind of. Getting to know the person like the sooner you can get

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
out

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and interact with the person. And see whether or not they're actually insane or

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.000
actually really

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
nice like that's really all. Well how many how many relationships have you like seriously from ships have you been

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
in that start on line three. Wow There's just something that I really like about being

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
able to go on a site and got as I'm saying this it makes me

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
sound like I'm someone like I feel like a psycho like I feel like I'm sitting back

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
here like like like they're like visions of me like in a dark room like no growling being like

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
neck snow I've had incredible luck with I mean I don't know what terrible experiences yet

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
but I definitely have had incredible luck with online dating and I've had a lot of friends who

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
like met their husband or wife. Yeah. And later the mother or father of their

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
children like on the day. Yeah. Typically OK keep

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
it. There's something nice and like a little bit reassuring about being able

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
to see how someone presents themselves to the universe before you sit down and buy. I'm

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
a total proponent of

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
like exchange a couple messages. Like get it out of the way and no need to

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
like write novels back and forth for a year and then like go me for a beer or coffee it's like an hour and a half

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000

ever tell you that after college I moved to my parents for year and a half I did not know that my

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
parents realized very

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
quickly that I had learned how to cook when I was away at school and so then I

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
like became a house cook. I was cooking breakfast lunch and dinner and I was bringing my

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
mother breakfast in bed like almost every day I might join those three are

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000

Hi and welcome back to sampler in the first time for today's show we covered puppy love

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
dating in our talk about looking calm after

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
that marriage. I'd like to start off by introducing you to one of

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
my favorite married couples Danielle Smith and Elliott Olson they're both journalists

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
with decades of experience and they've both worked as editors of major music magazines.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Elliot X.X.L. and Danielle at Vibe. Oh and they

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
host a podcast together called relationship goals that they taped at their kitchen table.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Here's a

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
clip you post this story was I was in the fall of two thousand and fallible. While

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
the who didn't and I didn't know that bond of address in the park. John sees the carrots in the radishes

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
and everything

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
else. And when I was case and I was like why the salad ready.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
It was gross and that with samples to ship in the US that is no Ross who did not

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
now believe back did. And if today was that there was a spirit that was probably very good he thought

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
that it was an olive oil some garlic and some lemons

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
usually time before going to fire why was it worth

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
stopping the street to

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
the right to come back to graze his glasses cases going anywhere near

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
foul salads No salads there's no salad Why don't you ever make me some face to

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
show this to share code because seriously I've been cooking in this marriage for ten

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
years could

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
be misread never really cooked and that stands someone who

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
was there for the next video.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Over bad a kid and I'm not holding back now I called him into the kitchen tonight I said Elliott might be to come

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
in here and air your keep That's

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
just the

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
right on Relationship Goals Danieli it

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
as they're sometimes called Talk about much more than the proper use of salad spinner's

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
they dissect their relationship and why it works.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
They also talk about music writing and their dog growth whole disclosure I find

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000
their pocket totally adorable and I really admire their commitment to letting it all hang out.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I want to figure out the secret to their relationship success. So I invited them to come in for

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
a little chat. They started off by telling me about how they

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
met Danielle with Eliot's

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
editor no way in hell did I ever think not them to marry and no I didn't I didn't even know if we

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
didn't know if we liked each other Mizar knew each other from John. But we never really got along.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Yeah we never Nevada law. We never viable and I was some people it wasn't like that thing of like oh they hate each

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
other so that kind of proves they like each other it was this kind of

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
like all right. It was a little

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
bit like Hi Ali Harzi now seventy Atlanta

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
is later tonight is later going to go to fast for that group. Yeah I

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
know. And and then I just saw him at a

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
birthday party. After light had been years and I hadn't seen

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
him in person in like two or three years always different.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Well the main thing that was different is he had taken the Choros out of this

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.000
is really working for me in terms of cuteness.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:19.000
I mean I

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
love a good core role but it just wasn't working recalled It was not working

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
for Elliott and

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
so you know it was. It was a real moment for me because I saw him and I was like I remember saying to

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
my friend

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
has always been Q. and she

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
was like I don't know and I said OK but he's really cute right now and she was

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
like I don't know what's wrong with you because you haven't even had anything to drink yet

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
so I went I went over there and I was

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
like What's up with the Koran like this is my super mac move right. I'm

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
like so I see how your hair you know all sassy like stop time or whatever touch

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
in my head yeah. If I could tell the story that I would definitely tell that part

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
but I was like Yeah it looks really you

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
know great it's about time you cut it or whatever and I did touch and I was like

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
So what's the occasion you like why did you do it and he was like that like I

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
did and. And then he goes he goes

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
My grandmother just passed

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
away

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
and she never did like the cornrows

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
and I didn't want to wear them to her funeral and I definitely didn't want her looking down from heaven I

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
mean thing in her school

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
rose and I was like OK

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
wow like we went on a couple of times and New York and then I was going to San

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Francisco to teach Barry to teach for a month

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
and I told him that he'd said in passing I'll come visit you while you're out there and I you know

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
I thought that was the usual kind of B.S.. Yeah from dude. And he

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
called me like the day before I was going he was like so I booked my flight and

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
I may need you to tell me where this day. And I was

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
like watched because I had a little

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
like corporate partners something there so he comes to San Francisco

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
and when I say. We hadn't really become

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000

like the first like day and a half we did not enjoy each other's company. It was super awkward.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
We were irritating each

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
next day after that we kind of had to see each

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
other I don't know if it would have popped off and honestly the last day you got food poisoning that

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
we had taken to marriage. I had sent an emergency and said no but in

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
general truth. It was at the hospital emergency room that I was

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
like OK he's a real person and I

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
just felt tied to him now it took a while for things to really kind of even work out

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
once we got back to New York but it's been on since pretty much that ever

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:06.000
since

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
then pretty much a foot I think yes it

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
was in any case. Any case it took a minute but then you know if you got married.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
You know it was probably a year and a half after that well I know well yeah so we're not merely a year and a half after the

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
great food poisoning incident how do you as a

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
married to an after your ten a half years. That's beautiful. So why she

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
start a pod cast the why pod cast about your marriage did you get the both done phone so many other

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.000
things

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
well one of the dude prevailing thing was us trying to figure out how to work together we

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
were good at competing against each other. A year in our marriage. I was still

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
addicts excel. She got off the job to go back to vibe and be a chief So then we worked

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
compete against each other which was really fun for but she knew we

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
was we knew the point we were doing it with their newlywed So we wanted

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
so we would fight over to our covers

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
and never speak about it and then put magazines out and then be able to talk about the magazine.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Once they're out. It's great that like at the time we were running the two premier urban hip hop men

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
yeah yeah yeah kind of going for the same thing and it's like in this well you know doesn't even matter anymore

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
to the different lane so they ought to be great not to be great is less of a thing of

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
us being looked at a competing for the same things I think that's helped immensely in like we still have our differences.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
But the end of the day we both want each other then

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
when the Like a lot of times it's all in our out together. There's always that one person that comes

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
up to us and says something to the effect

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
of Oh my God it is so great to meet you.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
You guys have the perfect relationship

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
and I got this want my relationship to be

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
like your relationship and Elliot and I are always like

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
no no like we have a great

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
relationship is by no means perfect. Yeah. And we work on

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
it all the time and it's fun but it's really

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
hard that you can't really say that to a person like you know The Times is like in the bar or

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
whatever so we wanted to talk about the fact that you know because people say oh did something and they would

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
say you guys are my relationship goals and that's why we need that because we're like we need to explain to

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
you that relationship was like that well

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
yeah way but like I mean you know not to sound exactly like the person who's always approaching guys in

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
the bar but one of the things that like I was new I pretty much every single week and

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
it's really

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
comforting like my parents a man for thirty six years and they have a similar dynamic

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
where they're always kind of like talking with each other poking fun at each other and like listening to your show was

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
the first time because I'm not where I'm twenty and I venture I would like to get married in the future

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
but is that is that you kind of has to do you know I mean because like

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
it's not easy it's not like a cakewalk or anything like that but hearing the way you guys go back and

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
forth is kind of

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
like this maybe something like that source you

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000
know something or think I'm always I know for the what you want it can be really good.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Yet it was

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
you know. I think what a show that it never stops being work is the marriage is the most

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
like an incredibly challenging but rewarding experience you could have and I think

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
that we showed up but you still got to deal with this like the

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
person whose feelings are prominent not just shown films a promise

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
her feelings of dop your partner's feelings. You know prominent and then you have this thing that

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
should joined

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
in that always stays bigger than both of you in a sense.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
I know you know what I wasn't but I know if I do say

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000
so

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
my speech but the

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
body isn't what I make you

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
really love

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
each other to death. And I think that but we also respect the hell out of each other still and I think that we

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
keep learning that respect and owning that love from each other and that's why I keep in the through the forward.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
How has having a pod cast about your relationship right that a lot of other people can

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
hear how has that affected your life and shape how to change the

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
relationship. I think some things can be magnified when you're

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
kind of for lack of a better term performing your marriage

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Yeah and and there's this thing where I think I

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
get embarrassed much more easily than Elliott does

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
and just more self-conscious than he is

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
about you know presenting myself and presenting our marriage and so some

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
of being on the podcast for me has made me sort of shrug my

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
shoulders to some of that morsel and sort of be like well you know life is life.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
This is us and people can like it or not like I haven't always had that

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
attitude and I think I'm getting a little bit more of that and I think it's good

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
but then there's other things that I feel like I said are magnified like. Alice is really

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
sarcastic

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
and on a daily basis. It's so fun but then on

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
the part I feel like he's the more sincere. You know I like but if things

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
are magnified big. If you feel like you're doing in front of people and

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
it's going to be you know like the executive producer the pockets in this

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
and also the performer. So I feel like you know we kind of go by

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
what Danielle thinks is cool enough overall a lot mostly across town

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
to what I'm seeing that my pension has legs and I'm like giving him the kind of

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
funny just ignore me.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
I don't normally do it on

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
OK So relationship goals. Michelle ship told the

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
golden heart. I think it's fat a lot by the segment that you guys do

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
called tips in this era the interview you guys could please close

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
our conversation by providing our listeners with a relationship

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
tip Ellis. The worry about being right make it right. Like I

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
think sometimes you get so caught up in you don't agree on

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
something you have to be right there's really nothing to this noble prize you get the

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
winning argument you just really need you only argue because you want to have some type of understanding right. So yeah

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
sometimes I see with

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
me I will get caught up in I have to be right. I'm right and you're wrong. It's not really about that it's

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
just trying to figure out what you call and understand something I need if

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
you disagreed with how to move on so and how do you then make it right.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Oh just have rules of who's job is what in the house just don't change. Just let that be

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
a lifetime decision. So whoever's job it is to do the trash. That's a

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
job for life. I haven't taken the trash on to you and even when I was living in

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
California and it was living in New York. I

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
literally would try to save not taking the trash out so I

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
only had Davis Christmassy OK I got him yeah i Guy

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Gavriel.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
I know I'm not alone in thinking this but how teams are doing now in L.A. yet like they both have the same

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
job they're both in the same industry and it just really reminds me I know of any guys.
