Mystery show is brought to you by kind snacks kind snacks lunch to help you celebrate everyday acts of

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
kindness spot someone being kind and you can send that person a kind snack.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Wait how is that even possible in what you're asking yourself right now.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Well actually easier than you would think he's got how kind of you dot com slash

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
mystery to get

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
started one afternoon. My friend Miranda and I were

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
driving around Los Angeles. What were we doing that day

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I was getting my shoes fixed and I was with

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
you like a good friend who's willing to do errands or way

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to hang

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
out it was the kind of day where everything felt fun and a little

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
charged even shoe repair and then

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
we stopped at a red light parade and

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
how long do you remember that red light being.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I you know I want to say like maybe twelve to

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
fifteen

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
minutes in my experience about light like we're still there. That's how long it

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
was I guess it was a kind of thing where you realized it was long you commented on

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
it forgot about

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
it and then hours later were like oh my God you know what I just realized we're still

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
at that like right right. And here's the thing like when

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
you're stuck at a light you're kind of just looking for anything to read

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and look

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
at we were just very willing to jump down any rabbit hole we could

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
such a mess. And there one was right in front of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
us a mystery.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.000
What did we

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
see we saw a license plate. That's

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
a lot of nine eleven.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Yes we did.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
That's exactly what we

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
saw.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.000
To

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
be technical we saw a license plate with the letter i followed by the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
letters L.U.V. and then followed by the numbers nine and one

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and one and I love nine

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
eleven we were looking at the cars all around us of the people and like Is anyone seeing this.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.000
How can this

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
be right here in broad

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
daylight

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the plate was attached to an old Buick wagon half Asian half a sort of orange you

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
can colors the cars don't come in anymore.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We couldn't stop talking about it we

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
would try and move on to a new topic of discussion but we just kept coming back to the plate. What

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
could it mean the most obvious explanation that the driver was a terrorist didn't

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
even make sense since the last thing a terrorist would

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
do is get a license plate. That said I'm a terrorist. We had

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
the distinct impression that the driver was trying to communicate something powerful to us.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I mean just think about the steps

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
involved in getting a band the plate that says I love nine

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
eleven standing in line the D.M.V. to get the wrong form standing in line at the D.M.V.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
to get the right form standing in line at the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
D.M.V. to turn in the form the person would have

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
had so many opportunities to reconsider and yet they powered

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
through determined to declare their love to a world that couldn't possibly

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
really we didn't know

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
if we'd ever understand that love but we felt the need to at least decipher

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
it

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
when the light finally turning green at a point so far into the future that everything that's

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
in fashion now return

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
to fashion again to the world seemed exactly the same we got into the left hand lane.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
We are now directly alongside the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Buick The driver was an elderly woman in my memory. She was

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
wearing the kind of hat. You might wear to church. The idea of not finding out the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
answer. Crazy. I wanted to get out of the car make the universal gesture

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
of roll down your window and tell me what your inscrutable vanity plate

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
means Instead we turned left and the woman and the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.000
answer went

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
straight back then I think it was anything else I could do about

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
it but now I

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
do was the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
one from gimlet I'm stylee kind. And this

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
is a mystery show was

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
this every week I solve a new mystery mysteries

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
that can't be solved online mysteries that can't be solved yourself why is

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
the

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
zone one to mention names when you

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
mean unless you're me because

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
this week on mystery show the mystery is

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
mine First off I

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:23.000
know you.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
you've got your work cut out for you know got a lot of work on my gosh I don't know how you're going to find

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
her what I'm picturing is you're going to go back to about like she's going to still be there.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Well it was a very long life. So what's going to happen is I'm going to run the plates.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Out great. I'm investigating the

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
leads then I'm going to give you a report. I love. And I for my part. Well

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
just wait

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
for my first task was to head to a police station to ask a cop. If you could run a complete

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
strangers license plate and give me her personal contact info.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Once

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
inside the station. I met a police. GENTE wasn't allowed to talk to me on tape. But he was

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
permitted to shoot the breeze with me for a while he told me how much he

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
was looking forward to retiring three years from

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
now he planned on moving to the country so that his daughter to grow up riding horses

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and he and his son could sit around all day playing guitar and

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I asked him if he could run a license plate number.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
He said he could have because a plate was right in front of him where he could see it or he had an

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.000
official reason to do

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
so at a feeling that didn't include because I just really want to

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
know

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I wish to sergeant. Good luck going to feature life and left to pursue other

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:49.000
options

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Starlee Hi How are you.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
This is Dan. He's an investigative journalist I thought he might have some advice for

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
me about how to get a cop to run a plate. He said it wasn't a matter of asking the right

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
way it was a matter of asking the right cop he knew one who owed him a

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
favor but I don't want to get the

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
hopes up too high. OK because the last time the

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
car had a valid registration was from August two thousand and

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
ten to August two thousand and

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
eleven that matches up with my timeline of when I last saw

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
it but the problem is because it's not registered to check in the name on

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
it really. That's how that works.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And if you can see who was previously registered to that it could get that

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
information right now it's a bit of a dead

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
end did it show when the license plate was first got there any record of

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
that I don't see that here. No business

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.000
saying anything

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
about it well that's a business in this now

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.000
it is

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
a vendor eighty two thousand and eight the

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.000
previous

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
license and. As another number here read it but I want to bring that number.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Yeah well let's find out

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
OK You got the experience not going to see it at all previous

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
by daring told me he'd have to go through a cycle of non favor

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
related phone calls to a guy before he'd be able to hit him up about the second plate. I

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
understood and told him I'd wait for him to get in

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
touch

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
with him and

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
been

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
there something that might have already occurred to you that never once occurred to Miranda and me but

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
we're stuck at the light that day.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
What if we were reading the license plate. I love a nine eleven

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.000
All

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
right

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
big big bang You

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
mean let's consider some alternate theory.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Perhaps your favorite Bible passage was singing praises to the Lord which while it's in

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Zion clear among the people he's doing from nine

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
eleven

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
or maybe it was simply a matter of improper punctuation. We were inserting

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
a forward Flash nine eleven where there should have been a period. Ninety

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
one point one.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Corporate Control is not an issue with ninety one X. more local independent radio.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
So it could be ninety one X. in San Diego. This is one of my

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
investigators there which as implied by the acts like all X. stations across

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
America it's like an all rock

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
station

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and it is not because I

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
love Nine one one ninety one point one F.M. and ten Diego.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
But I think my brother was the

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
ex station where I'm from in Tampa Bay is ninety seven X..

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And my brother has this really lucky streak of winning all of their like water

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
competitions like we tallied it up at Thanksgiving last year and he's won

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
like something like seven thousand dollars worth of like gifts and trips and stuff from like the

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
caller number ninety seven really you know I think there is no in the like on their Facebook page

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
like so like he won a trip to New Orleans he won Lehman's concert tickets like backstage passes

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
all the time so I think my brother actually my brother is the kind of person who

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.000
would get.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I love this would be ninety seven I think it's ninety seven to one. Yeah I

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
love nine seven one and Tampa Bay. I'm going purely on got here

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
OK. Even so Eric still only gave it a twenty percent chance.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Ninety one X. was broadcast at a San Diego which he worried was too far away from

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
L.A. Dave contest.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Yeah I'm sure they do what I'm saying now if I were to pull back

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
I did ma'am.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And it's the old York City. So if I were you I get

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
an audience that

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
than you if you're not

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
one that was

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
a contest. It was a contest.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I don't know I feel you're gonna have to what you're going to have to pump that percentage up a little bit.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
OK fine I will I don't think twenty percent is a lot for someone who doesn't live in San Diego.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Because that was like we would love

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:40.000
definitely

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
given to the difference in the quality of love L.-O. V.-E. versus

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
L.U.V.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
at one point in my life I would have said no you mean like when you were like a teenager

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
L.U.V. and they had to call you know it all you see therefore it is L.-O. v right.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And then. But now you get older and I think there's like a more distinct separation between the two.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
That's sad too isn't it like usually like to do stuff.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I didn't know is a nice to

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
just tell you the something wasn't so much weight attached to it like the weight of a

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.000
moving

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
vehicle would

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
seem more likely than a Saum more likely even than a radio station that was daily

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
affiliated to the radio station where Eric's brother kept winning contests was at the numbers nine one

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
one meant nine one

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
one everyone I knew seem to think so first I would tell

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
them about the plate pronouncing it as I love nine eleven and they'd be shocked.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Then I'd bring of the possibility of a being I love Nine one

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
one and they'd say oh yeah that's probably what it

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
is now in hindsight I

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
think it could be that works for

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
the either just the police or they work specifically for

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
nine one one

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
like or like an operator

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
or nine one one like saved her life or the life

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
of her child's bed so a lot

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
of

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I didn't know when the woman had gotten the plate. I didn't know the Miranda and

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I had seen it ten years after the event that forever made the plate very

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.000
easy to

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
misconstrue whatever it was that this woman loved

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
she had to love it enough to be OK with

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
that with a nine one one operator really feel that

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
way I started in one thousand nine

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
hundred seventy four while. Seventy four.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
This is Carol. So you were like one of the first of what we know is nine one one

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
operator Detroit was one of the first cities that have a big city that had

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
it when I when one began the idea. Just one number that would service all your

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
emergency S. with such a novel concept that a typical call would go like this

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
a person would dial nine one one. The dispatcher would answer the caller would

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
say oh it

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
worked and then hang up eventually people figure out the system

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and then they decided calling in for

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
everything there was one situation.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I just picked up the phone and this person said there was a German Shepherd Dog I mean a

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
car and he gave me the description of the car in the location and

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I think that's like how do I say this without sounding like a

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
complete lunatic you

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
know but I didn't have much choice so I gave it out

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
and then like two or three minutes an officer comes on the air and he says.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Yeah you're right I'm behind this car and there's a

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
god sitting in the driver's seat and he had his paws up on the steering wheel and he

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
was aiming the car. What. You know so you

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
pulled it over and the guy had caught the dog how to steer and he was sitting

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
on the passenger seat working the pedals you know the break in the gas

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and apparently the dog did pretty

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
good so I was very. OK I have a lot of questions.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
If you teach your dog how to drive is that illegal.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Well we kind of joke around about who is going to get the ticket. But the guy got the ticket

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
they cited him for allowing in I'm a licensed operator.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Wait a minute to drive the V A Wait a minute if the dog I lived in would then be legal

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
probably this is probably not the lesson I'm still be learning from this but I want to teach my dog to drive me as soon

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.000
as I get off

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
the phone call. OK. Well don't do it in a busy road

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
that's all I have to say.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Carol tells me she would sometimes be the only dispatcher working and would have to figure out how to

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
juggle the different calls coming in the most urgent ones were

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
labeled hot calls. She remembers one night getting three hot call. All at

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
once there's been a traffic accident with injuries three guys in ski

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
masks were hanging around outside a communion store and a man was drowning his wife in their swimming

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
pool and

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
then in the middle of it is a lady called to report that there's a dead squirrel in your yard in

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
a halting this is really low on my priority list of the

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
moment

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
it's just your mind now ordered and prioritize things that way because of all the years spent

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
doing that naturally for emergencies.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
I think so I think you look for ways to fix things more and to

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
be more self-sufficient than some people are always trying to turn to somebody else to fix their

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
problems having a job or somewhere people call you for help has taught you to be more self-sufficient

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and ask for help less. Yeah it does that sound backwards. Oh yeah kind of because

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I mean counterintuitive that I would I would think that lesson would be. Oh it's good to

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.000
ask for

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
help. Well it is good dad for help I guess I just heard so much of what happens to

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
people good and bad that I think it just helps you put into perspective what what

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
is really something that's important and urgent and works just life and you

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
just deal with it as it

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
comes there are some calls that linger for

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
ever and it snows a lot in Michigan if you didn't know and so it was wintertime

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
and it was snowing in this woman was driving to work and she lost control of

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
her car and hit a snowplow head on and was

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
killed she knew my age she you know had young children and

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
it's like you know that just took on a personal

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
call and it's just a call I've never forgotten. I got all this

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
information because I looked at the police report that came in after and saw that the

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
tail fin. I wish I hadn't got at that point I learned I probably didn't want to read most

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000
of the police reports because I didn't want to know that much about what happened.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.000
The

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
story I'm working on is about a license plate that I saw that said

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
I L U V And the numbers nine one one.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
I just been trying to figure out what it is and so do you think it's possible to love Nine one one.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
I do my guess would be someone who works for it really that would put that. Yeah.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Why my license plate was

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
ten nine and that was the police code for repeat your message

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
that when your license plate really. Yeah that was a personalized license plate. Well we thought

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
of was the police radio codes on people's license plates we generally knew

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
that they work for an agency.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
So you see other license plate that I have little they have police codes radio codes or not only one reference

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
is in them.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Yeah it's not

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
uncommon so you love Nine one one.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Yes I would say I do. I mean you know you you really and truly can

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
help people you know most days you go to work and

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
it's just a job. I'll be ro honest it is just a job but you

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
know every once in a while you get that call where you get the police and the fire

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
there in time to help save somebody. It's

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
exciting it's definitely not pretty firmly over to the Not that it's a nine one

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
one license plate

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
argument that would be my that's what I would think if I saw. Yes I think they're

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.000
proud of

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
it I love Nine one one. Had just edged ahead as the

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
most convincing theory one I felt compelled to believe unless I found the

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Buick's driver and she told me

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
otherwise I was a reservation for you. Here's Derren again.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Coach tell you something really funny that happened on the way to getting this. So

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
I sent the new license but the other lesson spoke to my

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
friend and while I'm waiting for him to get back to me because it was another computer that while

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
waiting for him to get back to me I'm sitting in. Office and also I hear. A crack outside and I

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.000
look at my

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
window and some guy has sideswiped my car and not the side view mirror

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
all really. Yeah he takes off

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
and I go chasing them down the block like a lunatic much

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
lepers and he gets away. He burst into

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
light but the guy has a vanity plate. So my friend comes back to me with the

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
answer to your plate and then I had a right to back and say actually if you have time to run one

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
or it turns out the guy lives on the block.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I just provide this morning and it was there in the car and the car was there so I think a

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
back to the back I would have to run I will swear I didn't want to show up like looking like an adult and

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
I take a shower and I go back.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
It's his vanity plate you'd understand then I love now and then yeah

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
yeah definitely it's like I love sites like

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
being exactly what it was I wrecked

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
cars in the course of a like a couple weeks of running a bunch of

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
ice but that's evolved out of one for my entire life and I feel like a part of life.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
So you want to know about your license but yeah

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
OK so I got a name really. Yeah. Wow I'll tell you the

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
name and you can believe whatever you need to

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
believe the name

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
is now the bomber is that there's an address

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
here but the bummer is is that it's a pill box.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Oh this person this one down. OK Things person is the opposite of

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
the person who sidelined Not only that the person I was looking for and

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
thinking to clear his name really

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
easily just walk down the block walk on the block.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
OK but we have appeal box I can send a letter and we have a name.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
The only thing now is that there's a lot of pressure on you to write a letter that they get responses

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
and I could tell how much is New Zealand and I would say Just don't over think it.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
OK I always overthink it and it takes me as you know my last letter I wrote

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
a letter. Over and over again for like two

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
months and then the other just like replied Yeah what's

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
called so don't overthink it. So I would think

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
that

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
I write a letter and mail it to the people Box address feeling like I was right back where

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I started once again

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
waiting

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.000
to know what that felt

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
like during this short

installment of the ingredient list. And do the kind thing for your world.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000
I thought the hard part of solving what I love nine eleven meant would be finding out the driver's identity.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Once I had that I assume that everything that followed would be as easy as teaching a dog to

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
drive a car but incredibly the driver. Let's call her Margaret was

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
becoming more of a mystery to me

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
with every attempt. I made to reach out to her. I waited weeks for a response

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
the letter I sent but never heard back. I searched public records for every possible

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
combination of her name and then called her a number that came up. No one ever answered

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
each number had some version of anonymous outgoing message.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000
This was the woman who put such a personal message on her license plate but he couldn't leave a simple.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Hi I'm not in right now on her voicemail. I

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
would have just knocked on her front door but I couldn't find another address for her the on the P.O.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
box but then finally another one of my investigators Melinda made a discovery.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
I just did a cross reference. That excited me where I figured

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
out married name I

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
think thirteen under this new name. Linda had then found a house headdress that had the same phone

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
number listed as a P.O. box. We now knew where Margaret lived

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
or at least had one slipped.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
I did a search to see if she was still getting utilities build there.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
So did

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
what even if Margaret wasn't living at this address anymore.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
It was still the best lead I

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
had We're getting close this is our exit just six minutes and

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
well being as how is my first stake out

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
and I wanted to do it right. Stale coffee

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
check read Bines check stakeout

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
partner check at this block again honey looks like a look see here. OK Let's blow this is

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:49.000
my friend

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Matt his main stakeout partner

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
qualifications are that his schedule is flexible and that he's prone to grumbling. I think we should

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
call and complain because that is was ridiculous.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Imagine rush hour. Forget

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
it it be there for an hour.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
It's after eight when Matt and I arrive in Margaret neighborhood as well as return to her

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
street it dawns on me that OK maybe they hadn't taken everything into

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
account like that at one time it's

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
dark to see anything. I can't even see any numbers.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
After much squinting and significantly

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
more grumbling to figure out which house is hers.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Look at this. Wow this just got really

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
real it's an anonymous voicemail message where a house is it would look like Margaret.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
There's like no

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
lights no car in the driveway.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
There was also no sign of the

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
concrete My plan had been to use the car as an entry point into a

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
conversation with

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Margaret without the car in sight though I didn't know what the next step

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
was. And Matt and I couldn't stake out the house since all the good stakeout spots had been

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
taken if there was a spot rent under. To sit there with the onesie.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
But we were on easy street. We were on hard

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
street at the intersection of frustrating and

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
questionable but wait that was that a glint of metal I

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
thought yeah there's a car back that showed that I'm going to make her

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
like dollars. I don't know why we were whispering the windows were closed. All right and with us

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
watching

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
what Matt and I pull into the driveway as though we're making a U.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
turn and there's a low gate and I had light shines through.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Eliminating the back of the

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
driveway and then from behind the house with just his nose poking out

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
and we see all this as he said

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
it's that it's

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:50.000
hard it's harsh. It's because it's definitely the car cat we found it.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Now you're going to point is no. Wow this is a great

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
success to pull back into the

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
street the cars swallowed up by the darkness. Once

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:23.000
more

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
having

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.000
confirm

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.000
that

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.000
I

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
had the right house. I set out the next day on my own. I Pod about side

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Margaret's of course now that I was an honest takeout. There's plenty of choice takeout spots

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
available typical I open the gate and walk up to

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
the front door. I take a deep breath and

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
knock no answer and knock

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
again no

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
answer and knock

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
again a slight shifting of the curtains followed by a

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
boy who is

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
it. Here is a detail. I had thought through beforehand

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Starlee I

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
say you have

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
a license plate that says I love. I Pods again

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
the numbers nine and one and one zero.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
That's my manager Margaret's car says the voice. I'm Sheila.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Margaret lives in the house and back. I think she's home now she's going not going to door. I

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
think she will step away from the door relieved by how smoothly this is all

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
going wait a minute that Sheila. When did you see the

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
car. Here we go I thought I would have to explain the whole story. The

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
running of the plates the calling in a favor how it was the dog's owner and not the

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000
dog itself who controlled the brakes and gas while driving a few years ago.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Oh that makes sense says

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Sheila the car isn't been driven since about then and with that the curtain

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
fell back into place. I had left my recording equipment in the

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
car and also my phone in order to feel out the

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
situation when I went to open the gate to go get it. Sheila called out like a video game wizard

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
and said I was going the wrong way. So I let go of the gate

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
latch and walked down the driveway to Margaret's house in the back between

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
me and her front door was the car its colors were a little more

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
faded than I remembered but otherwise it was the

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
same. There's a little plush stuffed animal dog perched on the back seat. I

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
circled around until I was standing behind the trunk and looked at the license plate.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
It was the same two. I love nine

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
eleven I went

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
out Margaret steps so that I was standing in front of her door.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
There are charges in the

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
windows a sculpture of a little boy riding a scooter and other one of a woman

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
dancing windchimes twisted in the breeze. There was no doorbell. So I knocked on

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
the metal gate. No answer. I knocked

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
again no answer next door the neighbor's dog barred

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
from the main house. I heard Sheila call out.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
She's not in there thought for sure she was you'll have to come back another day

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:24.000
then

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000
on my next visit. I wanted to bring Margaret a gift proof of my family intentions.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
So I pulled over at the first flower shop I

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
saw inside the store was nearly empty.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Except for half a dozen orchids. I chose a purple one. The man who worked

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
there seemed so surprised that I was actually buying something that he pulled out all the stops. He

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
offered to transfer it to a nicer

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
bass. He added moss and tied a big ribbon around it all the while he talked to me.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
About why he was from Mexico

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
City and how much he loved to travel. He said though that he hadn't yet been to

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.000
the place he most wanted to go the nine one one memorial in New York City.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
He felt that he really needed to pay tribute to it in

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000
person

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
I pulled to Margaret

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
south open the gate walk down the driveway

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
when chimes tchotchke

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
was no obvious place to knock I rap on the metal

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
gate holding the orchid with my other

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
arm no response. I knocked

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
again no response next door the neighbor's dog is

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
losing his mind.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.000
I

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
put the flowers down on the stoop that I knocked again louder

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
longer from inside a voice.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.000
It's so faint I press my air against the door in order to hear it.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Who

00:33:59.000 --> 00:33:59.000
is it.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
It's Darley who

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
hopefully here goes nothing Years ago I saw your license plate and I made

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
such an impression on me that I've been wondering about it ever

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
since

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
sweetheart says the voice my secretary gave me your letter.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
I've been meaning to call you. I like that she calls me sweetheart.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Her voice is so

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
soft I can't talk right now though sweetheart.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
I just got out of the bath. I'm wearing only a towel who

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
was this nice sounding woman with a secretary who gave her letters. What is it that

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.000
she

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
loved sweetheart after this I have a doctor's appointment. Can

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
you come back another day. What about later

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:55.000
tonight I ask and busy sweetheart tomorrow. Sweetheart.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
I have church. I tell her I brought flowers and I'll just leave them on

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.000
our

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
stoop Thank you sweetheart. Thank you. If feels like that instead of

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
two doors separating us. There's a

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000
hundred it feels like even if those two doors were to open right now she would still be just

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:12.000
a

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
voice a voice somehow wrapped in a

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
towel

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
to get back to my car and start driving. I mean said to days that I keep missing

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
the streets I'm supposed to turn

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
on and then my phone rings.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
It's a Los Angeles area code. I pull over to a parking lot and pick up.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Hello sweetheart. It's Margaret I

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000
only have a few minutes but I wanted to tell you the story behind my plate

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:58.000
also thank you for the flowers. They're beautiful.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Here's

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
where I tell you that my.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000
About

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:59.000
it.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
She

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:01.000
promised

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:01.000
a

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
copy

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.000
so

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.000
that

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
we could do a proper interview when

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
she did call. She said she'd been feeling under the weather and had to reschedule.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000
And then the next time she said she'd just been so busy trying to get her house ready to sell.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
We never get to the

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:24.000
interview

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
I updated Miranda. On what I had

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
learned is that she's solved get the case assault. Do you think the case is

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
all deeply profoundly like like we were right there

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
was something up with that place. You

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
know more and more I believe like there is no accuracy

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
in communication there are only mistakes. It is so hard to

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
communicate like love you know

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
or sadness combined with love like that's a very complex thing

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
and that's what brings us grace like it's not accuracy

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
and she trusted that when she made the plate that somehow the most

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
confusing contrary message in the world

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
would speak to people's hearts because her intentions behind it you know were so clear

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
and so strong it was effective. I mean all the things that made

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
our heart be turned out to be relevant and I feel

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
like we got her
