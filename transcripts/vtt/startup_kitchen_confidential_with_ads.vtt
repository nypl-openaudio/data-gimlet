Hey

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
just a quick note if you're a gimlet

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
member or if you want to be one. Stay tuned we have a little something for you at the end of the show.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is startup. I'm Lisa Chow.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
A few months ago we got an e-mail from a guy named Jason tomorrow.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I've got it here in front of me very direct Hello. We've raised

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
two million dollars and been featured in Tech Crunch's B.C. and Francisco Chronicle.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We now have three hundred fifty thousand dollars left in the bank which will last until the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.000
end of

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
April we need to raise more money or we will die.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So we followed up with Jason and he and his co-founder Vincent cardinal agreed

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
to record themselves during this particular moment in their company's

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
life with a run out of money and close shop with the figure out how to turn things

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
around in time they didn't know we didn't know

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
either the result is a rare and intimate look inside one

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
startup and inside Silicon

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Valley and we should warn listeners that occasionally include swearing

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
our producer Molly Messick tells their

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000
story.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
one of the first recordings Jason and Vincent send they're sitting

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
outside there in the backyard behind the commercial kitchen they rent which is also their company's headquarters.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It's a cramped spot shaded by bamboo and next to a couple of exhaust fans a place

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
they come to sometimes when they have important things to talk about south a little noisy as you'll

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.000
hear on the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
tape today the thing they're talking about is their own salaries.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Jason talks are OK so I was pretty shocked to hear that you're speaking of the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
sea of suffering like I don't understand really

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
what Cheney until you have been using more adamant about this

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.000
than I

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
have I mean it's a it's a it's the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
self instance a little faint there. He says that'll save us a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
thousand

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
dollars the company is called bento and it does on demand through delivery and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the problem Jason Vincent are facing is that almost a year into running it. They still haven't figured out how to turn

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
a profit. Vincent wants to cut his on followed by the more

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
time but Jason's not so

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
sure. Obviously

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
like from a dental standpoint I appreciate what you're

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
doing it makes me feel like I should do the same. It's just harder for me to do

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
same but you know it's not easy for you either of them really

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
to write your

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
own family for anything and from my C.V. I mean I almost want like talk you

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.000
out of

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
it I guess my thought is on

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
this I would rather continue to pay

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
ourselves and if we start getting close

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to running out of money if things are looking optimistic.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Then we stop paying yourself. But at this point

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
like what if everything just

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
falls and saw the risk and then the why and the like then maybe

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I'm

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
investing back in the US and more cash in the

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
bank on the tape right here. It sounds like Jason drums his fingers

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
on the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
table. The reason it's a harder decision for Jason as he has two young kids and his

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
wife Sharon is a stay at home mom Vincent isn't married doesn't have children

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
but in the end it's Jason who gets one over after a lot of back and forth. He agrees to get

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
a salary he tells Benson OK I'm on

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
board for what you want. What do you want

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
to really want to cut your cuddles for you

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
have no ability to use her

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
salary like yeah I probably

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
need

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
it I probably need at

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
least six seven hundred dollars a week just to cover my

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
health insurance five years

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
earlier it was out of the you know the right house. Yeah

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
yeah

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
about thirty to forty

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
K. I will ride it

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
out that was one of the first conversations Jason

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and Vincent recorded it happened a few months ago in February but to understand what they've been

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
through with Bento to understand the extremes they've experienced you have to know how they

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
started because it didn't begin like this was huddled

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
conversations about dwindling bank accounts. When they first started Bento it was like they'd been handed

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
a script for startup

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
success and they played their parts exactly right Jason Vincent met

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
recently and twenty fourteen through a website called founder dating kind of like Match dot com

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
for business

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
partners. Jason already had the idea for bento and he wanted to team up with someone he would be the

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
C.E.O. and in Vinson. He found a C.T.O. the chief technical

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
officer the two of them are kind of a study in

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
contrasts Jason's the optimistic one the California native who gave up a steady job in his

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
twenty's to spend a couple of years travelling around Asia Vincents an

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
engineer quieter the pragmatist. He grew up in New York in Rochester about the time he

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
was twenty

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
four he owned a house not far from his parents' place but it always wanted to run his own company.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And he figured he could do it in San Francisco. So he sold his

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
house packed his car booked a room on air you end up living there for a

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
year

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Bentos business is Asian food

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
customisable bento boxes that they make in their own kitchen and then deliver.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Jason events and imagine the bento be a known brand like Chipotle a but instead of picking it up at

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
a restaurant. You'll open up an app and order it on your phone demand will be high enough that wherever you

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
are one of Bentos drivers will be

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
nearby the cars will hold bags for hot food in cold bags for cold

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
food individual pods of every dish that Bento offers and minutes after you place your

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
order it arrives. Sometimes it happens so fast that it feels like magic.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
They launched on stage at a startup festival with two thousand people watching and pretty quickly they

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
raised a million and a half dollars in seed money.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Vincent says that at the time it all seemed incredible.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen I mean to see that much money come in so quickly to see

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
so many people so excited about an idea that was kind

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
of like OK this is my life for the next four five six years this is what

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I came here to

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
do I was always nervous somebody was going to launch something similar to my idea

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
before I did this is Jason once that didn't happen then the reception

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
being really good people asking like what what are your expansion plans

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and you know how quickly can you go to layer to this without us like yeah

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
sure you're just thinking like wow how fast can I ask and ironically nothing's going to go wrong it's going to be

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000
like you know it's pretty steady line of like growth and funding and.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Bento did

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
grow when Jason and Vincent talk about the months after they launched they use words

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
like insatiable and crazy

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and freaking every week they sold more Bentos than the week before three months

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
after launch they added a head chef an operations person and a new developer to work on their app.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
They moved into a bigger kitchen. It was what they wanted it was what their investors

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
wanted growth equaled success and they were killing it.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
But then came late August five and a half months after launch. That's when Jason got a report back from

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
his accountant. It was a regular monthly report showing here's how much we spent how much we are

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and what our burn rate was and it was for the previous month

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
July was very late to get back July but we got it back and we

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
burned on a sale like seventy thousand dollars more than we

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
expected which is like thirty forty percent more and it was like whoa what happened.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
The short answer to that question what

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
happened is that Jason and Vince and our tech guys tech guys who had started. What

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
was basically a restaurant there were a lot of details to manage Bento was hiring

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
cooks buying soft pans dispatching drivers they were ordering wild caught salmon

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and avocados and Asian

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
pears they needed to take inventory make sure pricey ingredients weren't going to waste.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
There were a lot of details. A lot of costs that Jason wasn't tracking closely.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And turn imagine with that day when you got that report that most of what you've been seeing this week over

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
week growth you thought everything was like totally going the way you wanted it

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
to so what did you feel. I mean almost it's almost

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
like a little

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
embarrassing because I should

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
have been watching that especially in like an

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
operational intensive business like this so like embarrassed that I hadn't done that before

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
scared I was to like where the problems were scared like was I going to be able to

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
find where the problems were.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Yeah. So it's just a lot of different thoughts. He wrote to Vincent to tell him about the report.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I was walking into work and I had I read it on my phone I just sort of one

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
time I mean my immediate reaction was like holy you know Holy

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
F..

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
It wasn't exactly a problem that they were spending more money than they were

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
making a lot of startups do that especially in the early stages when they're trying to get

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
customers but Jason and Benson had burned through way more than they planned in July

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and August alone. They'd used up almost a third of the money they'd raised to make and deliver

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
a bento that sold for twelve dollars they were spending thirty two dollars.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I trust that whatever was happening was working in that we were I don't know maybe we're in one or

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
two dollars not fifteen or twenty dollars on every Bento the

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
unit economics said something horribly ridiculous like

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
that but maybe the worst thing about the spot they were in the weirdest thing was

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
that the more Bentos they sold the more money they lost. So if their sales went up to

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.000
go out of

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000
business quicker growth no longer equaled success growth had become the enemy.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Vincent put aside his daily work on the engineering side overseeing the app and he and Jason dove into

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
the financials.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I was in our kitchen every day looking at the numbers talking to our chef figuring out what was going

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
on to get food costs under control that cut expensive dishes like ribs and dot com

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
See they let delivery times creep up they added a delivery charge and it

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
worked the price of the bento and the cost of making one started to even out.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
I kept thinking like OK. Not bad man I mean do this we can cross this this

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
threshold and then there are three days where we managed to.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
So we got to my positive opinion is this prevented or overall

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
that was per Bento then or they were fifty cents and there's a day we had a dollar for

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
like three days in a

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
row making money on a bento was a big deal an accomplishment but it didn't

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
last the days after that it just kind of fluctuates again back and forth between you know

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
negative fifty cents negative dollar loss and it was it was a difficult thing to control

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
maintain what all of this meant was that Bento couldn't make money with on demand delivery

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
dispatching a driver every time a customer pressed a button in the bento up. Jason and Vincent needed a

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
better way of predicting demand to reduce waste and keep costs under control so that

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.000
a couple of

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
things they added a new feature order ahead to let customers schedule their lunch or

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
dinner ahead of time instead of just clicking on the app when they got hungry. Jason and

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Benson also started selling Bentos to catering startup companies that work as middlemen

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
between

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
restaurants and corporate clients delivering lunches for office workers there are a lot of them in San Francisco.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
So Bento partnered with a few tears a conversation Jason and Vincent recorded

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
right around that time in advance the Larry. They're in a coffee shop up the street from the bento kitchen.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Jason speaks for his no we finally recently built order. We

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
finally know how to make money with

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
our wealth but we have no response. We know how to do. We've

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
got partnerships we've got

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
teetery we could leave this business is going to make money.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Very soon with a resounding that's what this is going to make

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
money that you disagree with

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I have with enough time he says

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
that's shorthand for if we don't run out of money

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
first look at the

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Koreans without look for additional work in terms of the

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
engineering which I would

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
have you know we've got we've

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
built so now it's about that's

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
key. You know like it's exciting.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Yeah it's exciting as usual.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Jason is focusing on the positive the catering

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
orders the promise of making money and as usual Vincent has his eye trained on

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
the warning signs the alarmingly small number of dollars in the bank account. And

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
also on that new order ahead option their customers aren't using

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
it which makes sense if you think about it if you could order lunch hours ahead as soon as you got

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
to work or later when you actually got hungry. Which one would you choose in order when you

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
got hungry and Bento would lose money every time.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
But you. One week later events forced Jason into the Ensigns camp he

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
agrees things are really bad at Bento at this point they have about two hundred thousand

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
dollars left and they're burning through more than a hundred grand a month

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
and actually probably hit me the most last night when we got zero

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.000
cater

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
orders because.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Next week's going to be

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
awful without catering Bento sales are going in the wrong direction. Jason

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and Vincent can't help looking backwards considering their mistakes.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Here's been sent overseas

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
starting with I was people

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
started thinking.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I hate to

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
say but this is why subject matter

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
experts make better founders

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
like what we have learned in the last year.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Basically tells us of the way we started the business is fucking

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
stupid but if we had been in restaurants or try

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
to similar business or works for us to knock it for three years

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
like we probably would have know all this and Bento would have just been

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
started basically where we are

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
today great. Yeah.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
But ourselves in our efforts so now we can look like I mean I agree. A lot

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
of these groups

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
are in the community and I think you thought we could

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
only push here if I didn't go to work. I did but we

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
didn't really push through a lot of

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
it but I'm sorry

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
like I had to

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
have the first we have smart

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
people encouraging us.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I don't know

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
don't know what felt like it felt like we were

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
doing all the right things in the right

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
place with sales numbers. Falling they can't go back to investors

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
they just don't have a good enough story to tell the days in advance and talk through their options they

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
come up with a plan and then Jason had turned to his wife Sharon the two of

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
them don't usually talk that much about work. It only comes up when something big happens.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
So after dinner when the kids are bad. Jason tells her end

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
was wasn't a great day.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Well.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
We didn't get any.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Hearing orders for next week.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Not happen last night. And then weekly

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
concerned that.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Well yeah. The last

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
three weeks we've

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
been doing really well on catering which has been good and the

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.000
next

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
week is going to be

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
awful like really really awful.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And so I think we may set

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
off as my. I'm

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
everybody off

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
tomorrow with a researcher set off on demand.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And Shafter

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
out like terminal.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Yeah

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I mean like close Bento now close then by the way I'm a cordless.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
OK

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
then are still trying to lay figure out what exactly we would want to do but

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
we would basically lay off.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Everybody. With a salary.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Can you please explain

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
more what you're talking about. Because it sounds like you're closing down but. We're not closing

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
it down but we basically like becoming like a caring business.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
In a catering business where me. Incentives

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
are still running it and so will still be like building software and tools and things to

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
like make the business more efficient but not like.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
It is today.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
He says they'd let go of their engineers and their marketing person and also some of the kitchen

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
stuff. Tomorrow. I mean it's not the kind

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
of thing that you want to procrastinate on.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
The good thing is we have some money in the bank so like if we do all these

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
things and act quickly like we could still have two hundred thousand dollars in the

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
bank and that may be able to last us like four more months instead of

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.000
like four more weeks. Basically And if we wait.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
You know it just it just gets worse.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
The next morning Jason Vincent have an emergency call with their board member. David Silver

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Glyde He's the C.E.O. of a small restaurant group based in San

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Francisco a David Jason and

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Vincent can hear So

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
OK they get to the point pretty quickly the sales haven't improved like they

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
hoped next week looks bad. And there's only enough money to keep the company going for eight more

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
weeks they're thinking about laying people off focusing on catering. What does he think they should do.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
David asked a lot of questions. Ponder that for a

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
while in my mind it's a tough decision because you're

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
conceding that you can't raise on this

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
existing But the other is very different.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
It's basically

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
just you're operating on operating a catering operation.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Even if you have the vision in the future of saying well here's where we want to be here.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
We want to

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
do once you're down that path convincing investors to come back in

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
because you're going to pivot and change is going to be. I think an uphill

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
battle and here it starts to sound like David is saying it's just.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
He can pay guys. This might be it. Maybe you should think about closing

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Bento I don't want to fix that have.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
I think a lot of it depends on what you guys want to do long

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
term. And where where you think you can get it

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
because investors are already saying you know there are attorneys already gone there not to be

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
upset either way.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
But now is a good time to look and say before we really prolong the

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
inevitable. There's some cash in the bank which means that you

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
guys can get paid to why I mean here is the kind of pragmatic there's cash

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
in the bank which allows you to do an orderly line down to get paid while you do

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
it and there's no loose ends it all gets cleaned up nicely you guys don't feel

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
like you're stuck dragging it out for two or three months beyond its

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
death on paid or you can't move on can't go do something else.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Yeah I think that's really Mrs Benson talking

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
here. When I said that well the alternative here is that we we nicely shut down

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
and everyone gets severances and a move on with our lives right I

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
mean right now. I mean I'm glad you got to call me now you

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
guys are able to talk about this now rather than in forty five days because

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
then there's not a lot left in the bank the line down becomes that much more painful.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
And you guys begin to resent the position you're in that much more because you

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
can't move on and you're stuck doing this for an extra you know whatever it

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
takes and you don't want to be in that position.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
So I think and this is true which is what I said I didn't want to do

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
but if you guys feel you can't get it to where you need to be to

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:48.000
fundraise now is the time to make a decision. Not in thirty or forty five days.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.000
So

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
when your board member makes the strong case for winding down your struggling startup. What do

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
you do. That's coming up after these words from our

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
sponsors.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Startup is brought to you by Ford Motor Company Ford recently brought a branch of the maker space tech

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
shop to Detroit because they understand that the best ideas don't always come when your work.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Well brick is the general manager at Tech

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Shop the Tech Shop the open to the public do it yourself maker

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
space is the kind of think of it like the gym for people that like to make the vocal

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
come any day of the week of the seven days a week and then inside the building we have just

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
about any piece of equipment we could imagine to make just about anything you could dream

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
up that is crazy and so cool

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
that a Tech Shop Detroit Ford employees can mingle with other inventors whenever

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
inspiration strikes and perhaps even create something that wouldn't exist

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
otherwise you have people of all different backgrounds scattered throughout the

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
shop working on all kinds of different projects. But there sort of rubbing elbows. These are people that outside of

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
the space. Probably would never have cause to run into each

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
other you might have a graphic design student you know brimming with creativity

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.000
and goofy

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
ideas who function today thirty plus year. Tool and Die machinist

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
from the auto industry and where the two and a machinist might say this is what

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
this machine does the urge to walk up to and say What can the state do and the product is something that

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
neither of them would have been able to do

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
themselves for inspiring creativity both in and outside the office

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
good for dot com slash startup to learn

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
more this

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
episode of startup is brought to you by their desk the affordable height adjustable standing

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000

you in you may have run out and bought one of the numerous sitting

alternatives like those big inflatable balls for this weird treadmill or elliptical desks they're

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
super expensive and make you sweat even out of breath.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
You may have also read studies that claim that sitting down is not killing you and is really

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
no worse than doing any other activity at work to take away your some. If you want to sit.

more go to very calm the A R I Desk dot

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
com They're at work

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:51.000
elevated

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
when we left off vendors board member had just given Jason and Vincent some stark advice.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
He basically said this might be it. This might be the time to shut down the

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
company our producer my Messick picks it up there.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
The conversation with David Silver glide didn't end the way it sounded it would with Bento

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
closing Jason just wasn't ready to make that decision. So we asked David for other options and David

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
said get your costs under control stop losing money on every sale see if you can increase revenue in

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:19.000
the next few

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
weeks so many choices every day but today we've got to get in the fall

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
a race

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
or it's three days after the phone call. Jason is in the bento kitchen where a staff of ten

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
is working on lunch

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
orders he invents and have a plan and it has ramifications for a lot of people who aren't

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
named Jason or

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
VINCENT There's a tall woman with reddish hair wearing kitchen clogs and tossing killed leaves in

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
a giant metal ball at the end of a long table a sushi chef turns out rolls with a

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
bamboo mat. The tall woman doesn't know yet that this is her last day at

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Banta that's part of what we're going have to do to start laying

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
people off.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
She actually can have a cover. This afternoon.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Yeah. So after this I'll go talk

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
with Vincent now that lunch is almost out the

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
door and. Will need to make some

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
hard decisions.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:18.000
The

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
last are part of the plan to make Bento leaner and simpler no more dinner service. No

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
more on demand delivery customers won't be able to open up the bento app and get their Bento right

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
away instead. There'll only be that order ahead option customers

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
will have to use the app like a food schedule or order by ten am to get a bento at

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
lunchtime and finally Bento will double down

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
on catering partnerships. But try to work with more of those startups that pick up food

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
from restaurants and deliver it to offices and corporate events.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Jason and Vincent lay off twelve people they ask their two engineers to stop taking a salary for a couple of

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
weeks one engineer decides to leave. Jay think that's his own salary to

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
zero Vincents already been taking nothing for a couple of weeks.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
I don't I don't think I ever saw that things would be this sticky. This

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
isn't that we'd be laying off half the kitchen staff taking

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
our salaries and having to make all these tough decisions. How

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
comfortable or uncomfortable are you with this reality.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
I think I was uncomfortable with

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
it for a while I don't know when or

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
what changes you maybe it was a slow transition but I think I just got to the point where you realize this

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
is reality and I could

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
certainly throw in the towel and just kind of walk

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
away for you know you could try to stick it

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
out for the next one or two months and see if we can turn this around.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
I don't know whether that that's blind face

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
or whether that you know whether that's

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
great I haven't figured out the difference yet. Honestly I'm not sure.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
For the founders of a struggling startup there's a range of futures to imagine there's the rosy

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
vision with a fleet of fuel efficient cars deployed all across the city bearing Bento

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
decals and then there's failure at moments like

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
this when it's not clear which future is in store Vincent looks to other people's success

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
stories to starting it was on the call was

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
finding he likes to watch videos on You Tube with elan mask and Jeff Bezos talking about the

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
early days. Musk flirting with bankruptcy. Bezos personally sending off

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Amazon orders and I would drive these things to use P.S.T.'s we get the last one we went

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.000
to the last

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
second those guys take risks and push hard but have hard work

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
and staying the course has very little to do with it after all plenty of people work long

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
hours and rack up debt and then they

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
fail in fact it's the more likely scenario there just aren't as many youtube

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
videos about

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
it by the time Jason and Vincent launched Bento there are already

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
a lot of companies doing on demand food delivery. Some are acting as middlemen between restaurants

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
and customers. Others have their own kitchens and investors were backing them in

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
the few months after Bento started an on demand food delivery company called

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Sprigg raised forty five million dollars. Another one called Montreal raise eighty five million.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000
It's different now there's a lot less venture capital going into startups than there was a year ago.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Investors are more cautious.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
They're not just looking for companies that can grow quickly. They're looking for companies that can show them. Here's how we're

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
going to make money and companies doing on demand are getting special scrutiny

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
in March right after Jason and Vincent did their layoffs one of the better known food delivery start ups in

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
San Francisco went out of

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
business a headline red spoon rocket shuts down amongst on

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
demand apocalypse behind pronouncements like that are real

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
experiences and real people like Sharon Jason's wife.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
That was a Croat in Cambodia. That was in

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Vietnam we took. Motorbiking got very very

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
last I met Sharon in Jason's apartment in Oakland where there's a wall covered in a picture of some trips

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
they took before they got married and they grew up in the same city Folsom

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
California. But they didn't start dating until after college when Jason suggested they

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
quit their jobs and travel Sharon was game. She's Korean American and for a long

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
time she wanted to teach in South Korea. So they spent a year on the move and then they settled in Seoul.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Even at that point Jason he wanted to have his own company. So it's been a big deal to see him get

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Bento off the ground.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
I don't know it's just it makes me so proud.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Sharon thinks back to a year ago when Jason was first pitching the

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
company when he launched bedtime on stage at the launch Festival last year I was

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:53.000
like ugly crying like I was just so proud of him and probably to start crying now.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:57.000
I

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
don't mean voiced. Like waiting. It was

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
just

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
I just know how hard he worked and when he was on stage it was I was

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
just so proud of what I came up to I started crying and he was up so proud of you and it was

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:20.000
like before he even you know sold a bento I was just so excited.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
I keep leaving that person like Curry got the other thing right now this is

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
really embarrassing. Well I mean

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
it's this person that you feel so close to care so much about who you know

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
work so hard and wants nothing more than to have his own business and it's. It's there

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
within reach here.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
And he did a really good job presenting do so it's like oh good job because he had been rehearsing with me for

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
weeks so I knew exactly what he's going to say but that I saw him

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
was just like

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:58.000
bawling. To you like what it represents for him.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
It just represented like his. Induction and to

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
this startup

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
world rather than you know thousands of people who have an idea and they want to

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
do something about it they don't really get to this point I feel like and he had gotten to that point

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
where it was like a real

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
thing and he was launching it on this huge you know

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
stage with all these people watching who were potentially be

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
customers and investors

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
and he was starting this company from our

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
bedroom but Sharon also tells me that the ups and downs of having a founder husband are getting

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.000
hard to

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
take when you think

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
about the idea of a bento closing with what comes in your

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
head to be honest

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
a little bit of relief.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
A lot of sadness for

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Jason even though he's

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
so logical about things that he

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
wouldn't he would be fine. Tell me why you'd be

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
really I don't know like we're going to have

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
a good steady income

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000
again and we could possibly start saving to buy a house.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Do you think he knows that you'd feel a little bit relieved.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Yes I think if I told him I don't think he would I think he would laugh and but it wouldn't be

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.000
a

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
surprise if you really thought about

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
it since spent a lot just Sharon has learned how hard Jason can

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
work how driven he is and she loves that about him. She says it motivates

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
her but sometimes it also makes for a

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
lonely bra for Addie was born our second baby was born.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Jason was starting bento and when he started he was doing all the dispatch

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
meaning he was

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
working he would probably come home at eleven thirty P.M. every night and he would leave for work anywhere

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
from six AM to seven AM So he was working like fifteen hours a

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
day for months and that was like the hardest you

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
know and I only had one kid at the time but I was pregnant at. Time

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
also and so I think that's probably if

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
somebody asked me about my life with Jason as a founder that would be my one thing that I

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000
would that I remember the most is just how hard it is with him working so much.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
And that's why him specifically when he was home like one hour a day in the

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
morning. It's Friday morning in the bento kitchen four

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
days after the layoffs.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Bob Marley's coming through on the speaker and the back door was propped open to let in some cool air.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
There's this knowledge and or. Jasmine

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
rice Bento five remaining chefs and cooks pick up the pace as the ordering deadline gets

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.000
closer

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
twenty customers have until ten o'clock to place their lunch orders and Jason steps out of his

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
office to count down to the end of the ordering window final they've sold thirty

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
seven better than they've done most days this

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
week overnight Jason has run some new numbers based on the cuts they've

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
made to breakeven the company needs to sell two thousand Bentos per

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
week including catering That means they have to more than quadruple their current

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
business a few weeks later I call Vinson to find out how things are

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
going OK so how are you. I'm pretty good.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
He tells me that the first two weeks after the layoffs went really badly. Instead of

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000
improving sales went down and Jason and Vincent both got

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
discouraged when a new catering partner brought them on and suddenly the numbers turned around. They

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
weren't selling anywhere close to the two thousand Bentos they needed to break even but they were moving in the

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
right

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
direction and that put Jason and Vincent back into their familiar roles.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Jason focusing on the positive trend. Vincent very aware of their shrinking bank account.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
It was late March by this point they had enough money to last them another month

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
maybe do you think that you and Jason are on the same page right now about whether

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Bento will survive.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:53.000
I

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
mean I do I do worry about his level of optimism.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
I mean I. It's

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
been I don't know certainly it's a whole year but

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
it's well maybe it

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
has been it's been a long time kind of like let's see what happens in the next two weeks let's see what happens in the

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
next two weeks. Let's see what happens in the next two weeks over and over like let's

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
just see how this plays

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
out and I don't want

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
you know I don't want him to play that out until the end. Like I don't I don't want people to come

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
in some random day and that's to say like sorry like we're out of money now that's the end

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
of it or to have applied cold people you know on a Saturday and I go we've decided not to

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
can you like don't come to work that's all I want to I want to end things.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Vincent has made a big decision. He's going to start looking for freelance work bench I won't be able to

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
pay him a salary any time soon and he can't work for free indefinitely. So he'll keep

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
maintaining Bento sap but he won't take on new projects. He won't be in the office much

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
anymore. Jason's OK with and since move. He understands it even

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
though he's making a different call he and Sharon are living on their tax refund and pretty soon

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
they'll be using the money they've saved for a house down

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
payment but with sales on the upswing it Bento Jason can't see stopping

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000
now it sounds like you might run into the situation you've talked

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
about a couple of times which is

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:26.000
like you at some point have to decide like how long can you keep going with no salary.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
That's a concern. What's you thinking about

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
that trying to think

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:38.000
about

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
if business and is able to you

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
know find something on the side it doesn't need to pay

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
salaries I think there's a decent chance

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
I could turn on a small salary for myself and then we can kind of cruise

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
along like that.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Part

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
of my analysis. Will need

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
to quit for sure.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Jason tells me things that improved enough that he thinks he can raise more money. He set a goal of a hundred thousand

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
dollars and his deadline is the last week in April and I'm not sure of Jason but put it this

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
way but to me it seems like this is it the last ditch effort

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
his final shot to turn things around at

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Banta.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
See it's Thursday right. Picking for money

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
e-mails

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Tuesday. It's mid April now. Jason's walking home from work. He's reached out to

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
three of Benton's biggest

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
investors have received two responses for

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000
those I guess I didn't expect it to be

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000
seen this isn't going to be easy of all three had said yes it would have been easy

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
but by late April he still hasn't closed the

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
round three makes a desperate call to his landlord to see if he can put off paying next month's rent.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
She says

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
yes. Jason tells Vinson about what's happening but at this point he's making the decisions on his

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.000
own then since freelance work is keeping him busy. He hasn't been a bento in weeks.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Jason and I check in again.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
What is it about you that made you

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
say I don't know I I don't

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
discount sunk costs

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
enough explain that.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
You know you're not like you know supposed to factor in some cost into your decisions right

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
so somebody who's can eliminate some cost from

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
their decision may have said yeah. Then it doesn't make sense to continue. So maybe

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
I have a hard time getting rid of some

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
cost but that's implying that you think you should've made a different decision by now.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Yeah sure. Yeah. If a year ago I asked myself Do I want to

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
be in one year. Let's say volume revenue whatever wise I would.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Of written down some big numbers and said

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
OK if we don't get to what number do you think we should quit.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
And I guarantee you the number would have been higher than we currently

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.000
are but obviously you know despite that I still deciding like we have let's keep going.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Why is that I don't like I think about the business that we've built so I think

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
about the problems we're solving I think about the customers that we have and it's just you know it

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000
feels it feels like a business that should continue to exist

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
and you know I'm proud of part of it.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Jason is still struggling to raise money but he tells me that the last few weeks have been the best ones he's

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
had at the company better than launch better than raising more than a million dollars right out of the

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
gate because he's built something that he believes can work. The kitchen is really

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
busy now just that morning there was a big catering order for two hundred thirty Bentos and then a rush to meet

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
the lunch deadline. Jason put on a hairnet and helped with the kale salad.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
He tells me that startups can be sort of like fantasy businesses they spend a lot of money on

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
gross on getting customers or a big audience but really the best thing to do is figure out how to

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
build a real business one where all the numbers make sense.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Bento is not at that point yet every week the company still spends more than it earns

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
but now breaking even is just a matter of getting sales up another six hundred Bentos a

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
week and Jason thinks they'll be there a week and a half later I get a

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
message. Wednesday three

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
fifteen as of.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Two thirty nine pm our round is closed got the last

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
ten K. pushed so over one hundred

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
K.. It's Jason letting me know that he's pulled it off.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
He's raised the money close that hundred thousand dollars around obviously

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
happy excited to keep to keep pushing on.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Obviously nervous about the other stuff. But that's I guess well I hope we're going

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
to sleep well tonight and start worrying about that

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
so there's money in the bank now but there is still a lot to worry about

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
tomorrow and the next day and the next their salaries to pay and bills

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
and deferred rent and beyond that there's a bigger worry about whether all of

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
this is worth it. How much longer should Jason keep pushing Bento

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
flounder again. Or maybe this will be

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000
the moment that Jason and his investors have been waiting for the one that you look back on years from

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
now when Bento is a huge and memorable company when he and Sharon have traded the

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Oakland apartment for an area home in San Francisco and when young

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:50.000
