your status is with Delta

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Airlines. Oh I am a Delta

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
diamond medallion

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
status. Very impressive because I I have spent

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
a not insignificant amount of the last several years. Craving

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and finally achieving Delta platinum medallion status. Oh your

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
platinum which has you know all too well is one with one very big level

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.000
below diamond

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and so I don't even know why I'm talking to you right now goodbye.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.000
From

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
gimlet media this is surprisingly awesome. I'm Adam Davidson and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
our co-host Adam McKay will be back soon. But this

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
week we have a very special guest host a man who is a friend of both

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the Adams Mr John Hodgman thanks for doing the show Jon It's my pleasure. And I'm

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
glad to break up the monopoly Adams have had over the show for so

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
long we should say I'm

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
sure you need no introduction but you host the phenomenal Judge John Hodgman that

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
is a great pod cast thank you very much you have been a regular on The Daily. Show

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
in those famous ads. I'm a Mac. I'm a P.C. you're the P.C.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I was and in my heart still am. If anyone at Apple is listening I'm I'm in wardrobe and ready to go

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
back to work.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So you and I were talking about hey what should we do what's a topic that we could do for surprisingly Hobson

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And remarkably quickly you and I realize that we are both

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
obsessed with this topic of frequent flyer programs

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
yes. And not just the programs themselves but the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
imaginary status levels that the airlines confer

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
upon people who travel quite a lot for work

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
or for chasing status level.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So I think you and I have the same question.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Yeah that is implicit in everything we're saying which is. Are you and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I suckers are we being played by these airlines dangling their

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
imaginary medallions in front of us.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I don't think that we actually do have the same question that the question is are we suckers I know the answer

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
yes question answered I profoundly believe that I have been

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
manipulated into playing this abstract video

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
game. And the real question for me is why do I still do it even though I

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
know that I'm being played do you truly

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
believe that by chasing an imaginary

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
medallion of status that you are making a rational decision that

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
accrues benefit to

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
you ARE a job. Maybe you think we're morons maybe you could just easily dismiss it

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and I want to disagree with you so strongly it

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
is central to how I see the world.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
In fact I think most people who study economics for a living believe

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that on some level human beings are much of the time most of the time

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
quite rational but

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I will agree that frequent flyer miles. Really

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
challenges that belief. And my fear is that frequent flyer miles

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and my

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
own and many other people's unhealthy obsession with this

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
bizarre arbitrary symbol of status might just prove that we're

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
not all that rational that you might be right that we are a bunch of morons.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Of course. So let's get down to the evidence in the trial of the century

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
are human beings rational or irrational. Here's exhibit

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
A Many people call me the putting guy they call you the putting guy.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I figured out a way to use chocolate putting to travel the world.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
All right you have my attention.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
This is Dave Phillips when he's not being called the putting guy he's an engineer at

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
the University of California.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So this story happened about seventeen years ago and Dave Phillips saw that healthy choice.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
They're having a promotion buy any of their products send in a barcode

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and you get a hundred frequent flyer miles one barcode so do it for one hundred miles

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
on one of four airlines you could

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
choose so he went out and bought one of every healthy choice product he could find he

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
bought chicken teriyaki dinner bean and ham

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
soup in my quest I realize you know some of these products are less expensive

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
than other and I'm still you know I'm an engineer

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
or I'm trying to figure out you know what's the sweet spot for this promotion

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and I went to another store which was one of these grocery outlet type stores.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Sure and. I saw a

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
display little display case with

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
individual cups of chocolate pudding like trial size

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
putting cups also by healthy choice. Each one had its

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
own barcode. Each cup each got twenty five cents.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
For a couple put an

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
ad is on barcode you get one hundred trick on flyer miles and I grab the entire

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
display and the putting them through it all in the box.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And your heart pounding Is this like whoa this

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
is yeah this is embarrassing but I was actually pretty excited I'm doing the

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
little calculation of my head and I'm realizing well this is a trip to Europe for one hundred dollars where the

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
putting the second he sees those puttings the game changes completely he buys all

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
the putting in the

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
store and when you go to the the

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
cashier at that first one I didn't really have a good answer but I

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
developed one as I as I moved on from store to

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
store and so let's just do a little role play. I'm a cashier

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
at a grocery outlet Yeah that's a lot of putting sir.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Why are you buying so

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000
much I have to preface this and tell you I remind you this was one thousand nine hundred nine.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So let's let's let's go through it again now you can ask

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
me why is there some mad about you reference are going to drop or something

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Seinfeld reference. All right here we go I'm going to get back into ninety nine and

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
you're right a very twenty first century accent. You know you talk different yeah. What's the

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
deal with all the flooding in your

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
cart

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Y2K

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Oh.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Wow

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that and I hate to use this adjective in a putting related

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
discussion

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
smooths so I live in Davis. I happen at my mother in law with us

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
that week who lives in Fresno That's about two hundred miles away. I loaded my mother in law

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
in the minivan and we hit every grocery outlet

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
store between Davis and Fresno.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And what's your mother in law thing throughout all

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
this she was she's a very make elderly lady who didn't know

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
what to make of it but she she played along.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Well why was she even along for the ride she's taking up valuable putting space.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I needed some help with the cart. So she actually did help me under under cover of

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
darkness I would unload the putting into the

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
garage because you. You know what your neighbors to see it. Yeah I thought in a way where Gee. Yeah I

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
think you know it was a good thought you had Yeah.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Then we would we had to get the barcode off the putting So it's this

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
P. process of peeling the sticky label off of the putting and collecting

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
all of those to make your mother in law do that

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
too I think everybody had a try at it and the kids the

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
kids kind of cooperated for a couple days and then their

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
finger started hurting elder abuse and child labor was.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So that's where I had to make you and your

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
kids do this until their hands were hurting.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Yeah I mean it was two nights I got pretty fast at doing it but I

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
realize there was a there was a deadline for sending an all these bar codes and I realize

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I'm probably not going to make it with just me doing A and then I saw this problem of what do I do

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.000
with all this

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
putting right. So what did you do with

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
it I ended up calling some local food

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
banks and after a few calls I actually found someone with a good sense of humor at

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
a local Salvation Army who said Sure there's a there was a

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
little bit of a catch I tell my all this putting and you're free to use

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
a you know I'm happy to donate it to you but when you're done I'd like to get the

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
barcode back.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
You've got the charitable organization to give you free labor even worse the

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
volunteers who said you know what honey this weekend I'd really like to help the homeless that's right I want to do something good for

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
my community. Oh well I got a better idea. There is that engineer at University of

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
California who really want to go to Paris.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
You'll have carpal tunnel at the

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
end but at least. A guy gets to go to

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Paris you make it sound so bad it was it was funny at the time.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
No doubt about trying to be it's funny now too.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It's

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
fantastic. So in the end. Days

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
bought twelve thousand one hundred fifty cups of chocolate

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
pudding and if you have a calculator nearby you. That translates to

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
one point

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
two million miles and he traveled for free on the

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
miles for the next decade. And if you have a calculator nearby you know that means

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
ten years.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
So give us what were some of the best trips you took how many trips do you think you took with this.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
She's done dozens of trips we did we did family trips we

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000
did one trip to Mexico where seven of us in our family all went to Mexico on frequent flyer miles.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
My wife and I flew to Marash a sub the coast of Africa.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I you know I flew colleagues around the world just for silly

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
silly little adventures it really was an amazing kind of life changing event and in many

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
ways. And where did you fly your mother in

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
law my mother alive

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
think got she got New England.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Sir I'm from New England. That's no

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
present she does not like

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
flying just give me a quick if you did the ballpark the amount of time you

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
personally invested.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
It was it was it. It was easily one hundred

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
hours hundred hours so yeah you know less than three weeks worth of a full

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
time job and the

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
money and the money a nationally it was a little over three thousand

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
dollars and why do you say initially did you

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
invest more. There was actually a kind of a an afterthought to all of

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
this I shivered. Since I actually did donate all of the putting to the

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Salvation Army. I claimed all of that as

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
a charitable

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:47.000
donation.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And how did that go with the I.R.S. did you claim through all three thousand.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Yeah Dave is now a legend in the frequent flyer

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
community and I guess John it's worth pointing out there is such a thing. Frequent Flyer

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
community they go to conferences and he just goes by the putting

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
guy that's on his name tag and people stare at him in wonder

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and envy. He's got status now. He earned a diamond medallion of his own

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
making I love how that story starts out. He is a total

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
sucker healthy choice had him jest where they wanted him. They were sitting in some office saying how do we get

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
people to more of our frozen dinners. Let's give away some little Miles.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
But then he turns it around and finds a putting and healthy choice became the sucker.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So that's the plot twist healthy choice didn't see Davy putting hoarder common but here's the thing.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
It's not just all the choice. We're all suckers right because he got a tax rebate for

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
the American taxpayers paid for his unhealthy and I would say

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
irrational obsession with showing up healthy

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
choice but from an economic standpoint there is no question this guy was

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
wildly rational only rational to

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
see footing that you can buy for twenty five cents and get one hundred miles which were valued at the time

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
at around two dollars that's raised a pile of money sitting there inputting form.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I'm just going to interrupt you to say that under your technical definition of

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
rational a man with a garage full of putting is a rational being explain that

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
to me from my technical definition of rational

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
every human being who walked by that putting and didn't buy a garage full of

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
it they are being irrational. It is actually that is the

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
mystery. I have a piece of counter evidence that suggests that we are in

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
fact irrational. In these decisions I have a story about a person

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
who behaved completely irrationally. And I'm speaking of course of

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
myself Exhibit B. Why.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I was platinum medallion because of all the travel that I have been doing for this T.V. show that

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
I've been on and going on toward the end of last year. I

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
saw on my scoreboard. That is the app for

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.000
this

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
airline that I was seven thousand medallion qualifying

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
miles away from

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Diamond. And I knew that I had to get there by the end of the

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
year and I knew that I would need to fly back and forth across the country in first class.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I had commitments here and the

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
holidays and it was you know I really only had you know today. I think I could maybe

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
go and do a single overnight in Los Angeles but realistically I would have to just fly

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
across the

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
country and come back and I would have to pay for that trip to like and that would have to be

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
a first class ticket so that was going to be three thousand dollars and I wasn't even getting twelve

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
thousand putting cups out of it you know and I mean I had really worthwhile I was going to get I was going to get an

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
imaginary medallion. A diamond medallion I just want to say yeah it's

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
imaginary Diamond a man are going to write an area down

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
yet my finger hovered over the trackpad of

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
my computer I could have just bought it is like Are you ready to complete this

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
purchase and well I thought about what it would

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
be like to

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
be to be on the plane you know. I

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
thought

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
about saying goodbye to my son that morning.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Because it was very traumatic for my family so I imagine you know looking in the eyes

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
and saying well I got to I got to go fly to Los Angeles I won't be here when you get home from school and he'll be

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
like Condor stand you have to go for work and I'm

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
like well not this time. Not this time to know

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Jeff I think a fly across the country to get an imaginary medallion But you understand

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
son you're a gamer right. You know you know what levelling up is all about let me show you this screen you see how

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
the bars almost all

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
the way did other place. I got to go eat this power dot that's going to turn me into the big Pac-Man that's going to

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
allow me to eat the ghosts of my own self hatred for one

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
year. And then I imagine myself on the

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
plane and what it would feel. To get up that morning and leave and

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
go just sit on a plane for no other reason and spend all of that

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
money that good money. To chase an imaginary medallion like what I

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
feel good about myself to fly across the

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
country and then landed L.A.X. and then what have

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
a couple hours to kill go over to the IN and OUT AT THE AIRPORT have a bubble double Animal

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Style Watch the big planes

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
land for an hour then take go back go through the delta super

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
special first class entrance go up there silver elevator to their private security

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
line get back on the plane fly

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
back maybe watch Mad Max Fury wrote a couple times and drink a lot of free whiskey and I realize that probably the

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
best day of my life.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
All right so what happened.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
A kind of miracle happened. I couldn't quite bring myself to press the button and buy the ticket

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I decide I was going to sleep on it.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And in the morning I was going through my email and I found an email that I don't most forgotten about

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
which was a request from a public radio show in Portland Oregon Live Wire hosted

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
by Luke Burbank saying Could I come out in a

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
week to be a guest on the show because their previous guest had dropped

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
out and immediately I saw my chance and I said I will come

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
out if you fly me on this specific flight.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And they said first class and I said yes and I said well we don't have a lot of.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Budget for this and I said I'm hanging up now and they said OK I believe them into

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
it so wait you think that story explains that you were irrational. That

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
was incredibly rational you sat there you truly had a period

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
of wrestling with the benefit of this elite status comparing it to three

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
thousand dollars comparing it to other things you value in your life. And

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
then you realize there is a way to change the cost benefit

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
ratio by making Luke Burbank take money out of

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
his wallet and give it to you to fly you for. Class you were

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
being

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
completely rational and you know what I did when I got on that radio show in front of a live studio audience to

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
be interviewed by Luke what it did I just talked about my medallion

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
status and I rubbed it in their

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
faces and said I'm only Here's what I could give him a

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:30.000
medallion

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.000
coming

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
up after the break we need who helped invent frequent flyer

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
you ask the clerk at the grocery store

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000

This

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
is surprisingly awesome. I'm Adam Davidson and this week we are joined by John

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Hodgman Delta diamond medallion status holder. John Hodgman is my full

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
title thank you very much. Oh man I'm so jealous and we are trying to decide

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
if our obsession with frequent flyer miles is rational or a huge waste of

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
time more than a waste of time these programs. Pull families

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
apart it empties out thank you. Count's it makes you do things that you

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
feel ashamed of

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
later to get an answer to What are these things these frequent flyer miles programs we

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
had to go to the source.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
We had to understand the history of them and so to Lila Holt our fabulous

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
producer found one of the guys who helped invent

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
them to bring me back so it's you're the C.F.O. of what

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
was American at the time was that the largest airline or

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
just no evidence no or no. As an American was in deep

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
trouble American has like the six. Well I just USA I

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
was in one hundred seventy eight we hadn't made any money for a very long time.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Its market share in the US was less than ten percent.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
This is Bob Crandall he was the C.F.O. of American Airlines back then later he became its

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
longtime

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
C.E.O. And John you and I are the same age. I don't think we really remember this

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
but before one thousand nine hundred eighty eight. It's it's sort of crazy but the airline industry

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
was completely controlled by government officials they decided what

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
routes airlines could fly. They decided how much the airlines

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
could charge. It wasn't a free market in any way and it's hard to imagine now.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
But even harder to imagine what it must've been like in one thousand nine hundred eighty eight when all the sudden with very little

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
notice the government deregulated and they said airlines fly wherever you want charge whatever you

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
want and they had to create a whole new business

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
model is this too strong I mean I was saying it almost feels like the fall of the Soviet Union

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
or something that that you're going to from this centrally current Trold economy

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
to a more wild free market economy didn't feel

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
like that yeah I don't know that I don't know that I characterize it and political ties

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
that fact it certainly is fair to characterize it as a very profound

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
change but it felt huge. Oh it not only did it feel huge it was

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.000
huge

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
church like you're in a different business. The next

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
a totally different business. It was clear that what we now had.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
It's

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
a much more aggressive much wider

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
ranging business and there were lots of airlines. So we said well you know why

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
why should anybody choose rather than they have a guy.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Every time he or she flies that's what we want we want them to choose

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
us every time that Farai. How do you do

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
that so we hit on the idea of awarding

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
people a prizes which were an accumulating prize and we said

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
well what's the prize that people want.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
And if every piece of market research that we did then hair or have

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:37.000
done

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
sense is that people like travel better than any other

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
award and of course we're in the travel business so we therefore stumbled upon

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
the idea of frequent flyer

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
miles in the most brilliant thing we did was we use the reservation system to

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
keep track of it so you didn't have to you didn't have to stick. You

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
know coupons in a book we just we kept track of it for

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
you so I see Phil like you at first you're like wait we want to give people a little prize maybe it'll be a

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
toaster Maybe though get a set of World Book Encyclopedia and then you realize what wait

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
the thing people want whether it's a bank or whoever is offering the

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
prizes travel and we happen to know a lot about travel.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
That's exactly right. Do you remember where what was going on at the time that was comparable to airline

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
miles was

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000
it has an age range stands what R S N A I'm too young.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Back in the day there was a company called S N H. And they

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
they hand and they handed out Green

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Stamps grocery stores used them. It was primarily a grocery store product as I

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
remember we had some conversations with one of those women you know if we can if we really

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.000
make this thing work if this really works maybe we will replace Green Stamps.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
They did replace Green Stamps American Airlines started their frequent flyer program advantage.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
A week later. United Airlines started one than soon Delta

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
T.W.A. Southwest Airlines actually held out for a while because they said as just a marketing gimmick

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
but eventually when people stop flying on their planes they said OK we'll start one

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
two by one thousand nine hundred five Diners Club becomes the first credit card

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
to be part of an airline loyalty

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
program and. Of course it all ends up exactly as Bob Crandall fought it would There is

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
now like this shadow economy built on miles and points and awards

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
that exist. Alongside our regular one of dollars and euros and yen.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Like now when I use my credit card and. I hope you don't hang up the phone when I tell you this

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
my Delta credit card.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
And

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
I you know I go grocery shopping and i'm thing about the miles I get

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
the airline miles.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Well that's right. Of course F.N. that that's what we want to do. I mean that was it that

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
was the whole idea.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
We talked to one economist who has made it her life's career to study these programs and she said

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
they worked great for the airlines that it has been proven over and over that when

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
people join one of these loyalty programs they do indeed become a lot more

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
loyal to that airline. But what about us what about you and me what are we as

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
consumers getting out of it after all these hours of collecting putting How can I maximize the profitability.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
So I can believe that I'm actually making my own decisions and not just be manipulated by

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
companies expect that is exactly what I wanted to do because I had in my head. There's

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
some secret there's some something if we do enough reporting. We will

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
find out how to maximize frequent flyer programs you want to hear

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
the secret.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Yeah I do what is the secret. All right here's a secret.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
There's no one secret. There are a million secrets and most of them are not

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
really secrets they're just annoying details

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
that each airline has about their particular program that they can change whenever they feel like

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
it like you know that thing about fair code. Yeah like

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
fair code A and then P. or G. and D. right. Z.-E. and like they're

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
never they can just be a B. C. D. E. F. right it has to be random letters from the alphabet

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
to keep you confused and they all have different rules about how many bonus miles you get depending on the code

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
and everything else. Yeah I

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
mean to truly understand frequent flyer programs. It would be like a part time

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
job maybe a full time job. There's all these blogs the Points Guy one mile at a

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
time view from the wing million mile secrets to help you figure out how

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
to exploit frequent flyer mile

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
programs and most of what they list is just hey Delta has a new credit card that has twenty

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
thousand mile bonus only available for the next three months that kind of thing but they're

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
constantly changing what the rules are so these guys are constantly updating people.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Yes but there's a cost associated with finding all these loopholes it takes time it becomes as you say

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
a partner full time job for some people are they really rational for doing that.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Well actually let's get into the actual intellectual debate that you and I are having that

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
are the terms of this debate for me. Are behavioral

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
versus rational.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
So let's define our terms very carefully here because this all hinges on an economic definition

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
of rational in which it is rational to fill your garage with putting

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
and behavioral in this context I don't know what it means at all so you tell me Planet Money.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
OK fair enough. Yes so this might be the most obnoxious thing

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
I've said on the radio but I'm going to say it. I hate talking about the rational versus behavioral

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
economics debate with with lay people with people have not been trained in economic law for

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
I'm so sorry excuse me all these right away Oh I apologize. I just want to remind you

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
diamond medallion status I think I've earned this very brief economics lesson

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
from you it's on the back of

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
my card I get one error free. So I think in popular terms.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Everyone's obviously like oh well the rational school doesn't make sense I've actually met human beings and I've

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
had the observation that they are not in any. A rational right.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
But the rational school is more like wow people are nuts. Yes.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Over time and on average the nothingness kind of averages out in

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
the long form scatter graph of behavior. The arc

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
of madness bends to rational think that has a beautiful way to put it

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
this actually has big implications because if you

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.000
believe my God is going to be a big idea. Can't we just do a podcast.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
All right let's hear a thing about OK in the video right judgments are right this is the this is

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
why for presently and we reach for something so I stand there make life different this is this is

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
why why Gimblet has a beautiful studio and tons of

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
listeners and why all the other pod cast that I

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
do are just dude's talking on Skype.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
About movies Exactly. Now. All right all right. They don't have big ideas I'm ready don't already I'd already

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
gotten is that where the money I'm ready to level up.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
OK so the rational School of Economics holds and people figure stuff out on their own

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
they decide what it is worth spending money on what is

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
worth worrying about but over the last thirty years there's

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
this other school it's a younger school the behavioral School of

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Economics which holds that people are manipulable

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
they don't

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
make always the best choices especially about. Calculating their long term

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
benefits

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
and generally well I like the behavior of school and I don't reject it I

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
do generally think that the rational school explains a lot of behavior explains a lot of

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
my

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
behavior and this area and I've thought about

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
this quite a bit over the years this area of frequent flyer miles

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000
is this part of my life where I'm like oh maybe I'm totally wrong.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
But in this journey as I learn more and more I came to

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
a conclusion that actually shocked me and also delighted me which is this.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
I think I'm really rational about this I did the math.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
As far as I can tell I spend somewhere between two and three thousand dollars more each

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
year so that I can have platinum status but

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
I decided when I looked at those numbers like I travel enough

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
that it is

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
words between two and three thousand dollars to me to be able to board the plane first and

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
not stand in long lines to be able to use the Delta lounge to get upgraded to first

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
class for free from time to time so

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
I'm being rational. It sounds to me like you're redefining the you're

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
redefining rationality so that you can claim that you're rational. Now here's the thing I don't I don't think

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000
you're telling the truth because if you were offered from Delta the chance to get all these perks.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
If you just give them two thousand

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
dollars means you may do it but you love the game you love you love earning them this

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
is better than just buying status you you've earned it. You love the status.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
You're absolutely right. There's no question. I love looking at someone's gold or

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
silver medallion and thinking I'm platinum and I like looking at

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
my Delta

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
app and seeing the little green line go closer and closer to my next status level

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
but my

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
point is all of that all that status stuff is just

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000
extra that's just there I say it. The putting at

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:46.000
the end of a delicious meal.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
minute I started a timer.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Thirty four seconds ago and it says thirty four seconds.
