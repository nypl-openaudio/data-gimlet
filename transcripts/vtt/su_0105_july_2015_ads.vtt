beautiful. I'm Alex

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Blumberg and you're listening to start up the podcast mini series documenting the launching of my

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
podcast company.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's the business origin story you never actually get here set down in real time most honest and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
transparent account I can make but then that happens every day in this country but we hardly ever see

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
firsthand starting a business. You're listening to Episode five. If this is the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
first episode you've heard you might want to go back and listen from the beginning but just to recap previously

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.000
on

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
startup things were starting to look up for my co-founder Matt and me. We had investors money in the bank.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
OK So so we did a check the account

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
balance

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and eighty five thousand dollars but there was still a problem when I went to

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
California to pitch my idea a network of podcasts focusing on narrative journalism and storytelling to

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
an investor named Matt Mazzeo one of his main comments was about that name on our

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
debit card the American public casting corporation.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I don't love the name a whole of the name is that this funny sort of callback to this all of

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
the Old Media times and leg with A.B.C. T.V.'s you know what I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.000
mean

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
APC's. So I get it. But. OK. One man's opinion

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but I was starting to learn an opinion that was almost universally

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
shared.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Here's just a partial list of the people who also hated the name A.P.C. my wife. Many of

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
my friends and colleagues several investors and my co-founder at

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
LIBOR I don't like it. I love

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
podcasts and if you listen to podcasts and you think it's a great name. But if you don't listen to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
podcasts just on the oh this is a company that does something that's difficult.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And so I don't think we should embrace the legacy technology that even we acknowledge is

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
not going to continue to exist. It's an off putting them.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
There's that word in their pod casting matchpoint is that by name ourselves

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
American pod casting Corp we're throwing our lot directly into whatever association people have in

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
their minds about the word podcasting he thinks we need a name that sets us

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
apart and we need it sooner rather than

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
later money is starting to come in we need a name that we can both agree on.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And so we've gathered in matts backyard to brainstorm late afternoon on a summer weekend and we're in

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
a good mood. We might be a little drunk actually we sound a little drunk compared to pitching investors

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
or negotiating our equity split brainstorming a name. Seems like

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
fun and the thing back to the stage we found so innocent. We had no idea

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
the anxiety the cost the time we would invest in coming up with a name

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
to kick us off. Matt read from a list of ideas that we'd both sent each other beforehand. The names here are.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Resonance. Story

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
tone cream. Most people

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
grossed up with and in the I like

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
it cream is we can't even cream really let me just say something about cream because I

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
like cream because it's rich that we're both explaining our bad ideas flowing. It's

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
high quality it's the top quality it's comfortable it feels like home so I like

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
cream cream top cream tone top tone tone

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
ship cab you might be noticing a theme here tone based names that was Matt's version

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
of American pod casting corporation would have a tonal

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
list. Just don't get to list at all like I feel like I don't

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
like those

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
those I feel like totalist.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.000
For

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
one thing after a horse

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
the kid

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
was a dual catch on. No I mean it happens to be the name of a horse

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
named after

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.000
hours

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
the

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
day we were discovering distinct preferences and naming Matt was more comfortable with a short sleek

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
a vocative name that might be right for a tech firm. I was more partial to Baroque tweak

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
throwback names more Brooklyn based artist no pickle

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
company to shake us out of Iraq. We decided to resort to other languages. Matt went on

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Google translate and started looking up words like audio and story and here in various

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
foreign languages Italian French and Garion. And then we hit

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.000
on Esperanto

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I think as Brant is going to help us here.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Esperanto the utopian dream of universal language developed in the late nineteenth century

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
to according to Wikipedia transcend nationality and foster peace and

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
international understanding. What could be more perfect as a basis for our name.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
We went on an aspirin to

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
binge talk in Esperanto disco a little

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
weird honest on a stand. Sounds like centuries of Republican

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
companionship can Alecto little hard to pronounce. But then we found

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
it a row and I like a relative that is what is irrelevant.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
That's near and in

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Esperanto I don't I think I like the sound for all.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
It sounds like aural and also it also sounds like Oreo which everybody has good feelings

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
about a real

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
low above of all these broader words like a role is very

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
pleasing or relevant

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
the the. One two three and three right.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Later that night. And our new name by my wife

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
nominee a

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.000
rela around locally.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
A real low. What is that a but is that supposed to

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
mean. Well

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
it's it's here in Esperanto.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Load

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.000
of

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
a good the

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
right to

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
want to have organically. How does

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
that come up are Janet Clee I was like he has

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Bronco a

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
do not mean was not alone.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Some people like to row but most reactions were violently and definitively against for most people

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
it called to mind the word Borel which is not a positive association something gross

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
icky and moist.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
In other words we were back at square one what we thought would be a simple summer afternoon exercise which turned out to be

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
much more

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
difficult and time was ticking our company needed a website and a domain we

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
needed email addresses and business cards and a logo and a visual identity and before we could do any of

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.000
that we needed a name.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Coming up our quest for a name is stymied by an unlikely opponent. That's coming up

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
after word from our sponsors.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000

Yeah I started listening to I would

up

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
by fall our lack of a name was just embarrassing. I got an email from one of our investors

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
saying he really wanted to introduce us to someone he thought could really help us out and this investor ended his email

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
with this line quote Do you have a business email now the G. Mail thing isn't the strongest but for. Word.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
But it wasn't just our own limited imaginations that were keeping us from a name we had the legal system working against

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.000
us as

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
well for example in late summer after many sessions and e-mails back and forth. We've finally hit

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
on a name that felt good signal bureau signal it had a nice feel in your mouth it was a

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
vocative and also turns out already trademarked trademark number eight six

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
two two zero two eight

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
five for the Daily Signal a website launched by the conservative think tank

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
the Heritage Foundation.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
There was one sentence in their trademark application that sunk us the claim that The Daily Signal website would provide

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
quote video and audio podcast featuring politics policy

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
news conservative commentary another name we really liked range media sure there was

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
an Australian navy company called range media that specialized in making industrial videos about livestock

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
for Australian agribusiness but we didn't infringe on them. We did

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
infringe on these

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
guys to me in that brief a big deal here big beautiful

say a country and western internet radio station out of Southern California

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
called range radio internet radio and podcasting were too close for comfort that our

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
lawyer range is

And

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
this is a problem that others have noticed in fact it's reached a level of satire witness

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
this fantastically profane clip from a recent episode of the cartoon South

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000

Congratulations. So one route around this legal problem is the South Park option get progressively

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
crazier and more outlandish with the name come up with our own version of free balls plopped menacingly on the

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.000
table

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Inc and. You see this a lot in naming Have you ever wondered why every Internet company nowadays

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
seems to end with L Y R I F Y It's to get around this very problem that we and the South Park

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
kids were facing we found over one hundred names like this right off the

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
bat bit league optimized lease warmly postcard Li bug a five

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
metafile Spotify just to name a few there's other solutions to YOU drop of

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Al flicker tumbler grinder blender you add a letter dig with two

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
G.'s think with two

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
K.'s occasionally the copyright problem drives companies to the awkward place of adopting two or more of these

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
strategies for example loom or three O's. No

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
we the other way to go is super straightforward the one name we had

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
no trademark problems

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
with the American Pie casting corporation and that's because a name that is purely

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
descriptive isn't even eligible for trademark protection. So yes we had no way to legally stop someone

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
from starting their own company and calling at the American public casting corporation. But on the other hand no one

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
could stop us.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And besides for me a name like

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
that fit better with my original vision of a slightly tongue in cheek old school

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
name and so I tried to come up with another name like a P.C. but without the word pod casting

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and also without the word American because as many people pointed out podcasting is a global

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
phenomenon. I think about it all the time during breaks from work or going for a

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
run even in my

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.000
sleep.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.000
That's

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
at thirty four

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
morning. And I

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
think my name.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
I think with the

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
name the global listening

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000
service to us the coolest things are.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Global listening.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
It's

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
like listening back

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
to this tape. I hear that arc that by this time was depressingly familiar.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
There's that aha moment when inspiration strikes you feel like you finally got

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
it and then the moment hours or days later when you realize with shame and embarrassment

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
that there's an obvious and glaring problem with the name visible to everyone else that

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
somehow you've been blind

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
to that problem being in the case of the global listening service that it's the perfect name.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:19.000
If you're a spy agency for a totalitarian world government in the dystopian future.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Matt and I were getting a little

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
desperate we needed help and so we went to an expert naming firm

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
called lexicon.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
He might drive a Subaru Outback or a forester you might have a drive a

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Toyota Scion or a Vince I would would bet a large sum of

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
money that you

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
have had a bottle of dishonesty water or stated an Embassy Suites

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
hotel along the way all those names have been created by

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
by lexicon.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
This is David classic founder and president of lexicon. And he recited just a few of the names that

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
you've heard of that lexicon is come up with there's also a little laptop computer called the Power

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Book that was lexicon the Blackberry phone. Also

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
lexicon. The chip that runs a huge percentage of all the world's computers the Intel

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Pentium likes concave up with that too.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
They agreed to help us come up with our name and wave their usually quite hefty

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
fee in the interest of transparency I should say I assume they did this because the publisher to the

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
story might generate for them but we never talked about it explicitly we just said we love your help we can't pay

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
you do you want to do it anyway.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
They talked us through their philosophy of naming a good name said David classic is an opportunity

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
to distinguish what you're doing from what everyone else is doing and the best cases it redefines a

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
whole

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
category before Pentium for example microprocessors didn't really have

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
names just numbers. The two eighty six and three eighty six calling that chip a

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Pentium elevated it to a new status. David and his team which included a

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
trademark lawyer and a linguist took us through their process asking us what words we felt a pit

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
in my eyes. Our company.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000
What our values were where we saw the company after five years after ten and they said OK.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
We'll take all this go back and come up with a list of names for you will also do a preliminary trademark

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
search and present you with a list of contenders.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And then about a week later. David classic met with us in New York and gave us the list of names that come

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
up with after a brief preamble he launched right

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
in so here's the first one. It's a pretty simple one it's called about that. It's just

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
two words put together. We're modifying everything with media because I think that elevates you

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
guys right. And so here's this you know hey you know welcome to the winds united nation

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
of about about that it tells people that there's a subject here that's going

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
on than the question is is this distinctive enough. OK so here's

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
a second is a daily

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
pitch set the scene we're meeting in the New York Athletic Club one of those old school old

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Money New York institutions they won't let you in if you're wearing jeans. We're in oak panel conference room

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
at the window you can see Central Park across the street. And I'm a little nervous about the first couple of

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.000
names David throws

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
out there a little corporate I'm worried is this whole process too corporate for us or not.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
P. and G. We're not Intel and these names can be too stuffy

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
formal David continues through the list. There are tone based names high

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
tone fresh tone home tone true tone the replays on media media curve media

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
spike there were invented names when David calls coined names so Vo

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
invoke nothing was feeling right.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And then he got to what he called the

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
flyers or the next one is really a flyer here OK this is this is limb and zest. OK.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
So so what is limited just do it adds flavor to a subject

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
brings something alive.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Lemmons us. It's too cute little on the nose but for me anyway it finally felt like we were getting somewhere

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
that could be right. He went through some more glisten and then Gimli years

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
gimlet OK Now where did this come from. OK.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Well think about you most people think about a Jin GABLER of ought to get right.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
So that's kind of a fresh experience right. Right so now my job is to stop

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
talking and start listening.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
I was certainly a couple of them stand out as sort of like I was I was immediately responding

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
to to I mean my initial reaction is these are really good options. I

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
think we have good options here.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Man I started talking about our favorites. Matt liked about that although I worried a didn't have enough

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
personality and actually we both liked glisten because you know had Listen in it but it felt a

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
little too a family on fancy on second consideration but we were both pretty into Gimblet

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
I mean there's just something so pleasurable that it's just so like who doesn't want

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
to get in line. Right

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
now yeah I like him a little a

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
lot because of the flavor of it in the face and the freshness and the

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
surprise that is one of my favorite names by the way I use I I can see having a

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
game with party I mean you know you don't want to you know make I said earlier don't

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
make things trite things like this and be careful about how you use it but I. I can see it working

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.000
like

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
that we continue discussing digging into the story behind Gimblet where that would

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
come from there was a major gimlet who helped invent the drink as a tonic to help with malaria. That was

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
pretty cool and the more we Googled the more right the name felt for example the phrase. Gimlet

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
eyed the expression given I had first appeared in print in seven hundred fifty two and the idea of

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
a piercing piercing or a sharp glance. So given I has a piercing or sharp glance

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
or observation came from the fact that a gimlet

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
circa fourteen twenty is a small sharp woodworking tool with a screw

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
point and cross and all four boring holes.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
So it came it has passed into an adjective adjective describing

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
sight understanding acute sharp piercing. I mean that's gross so great.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
That's what we're trying to do like in that really is

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
to by the end we achieve consensus. I looked over and saw Matt staring at his

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
phone after a minute he looked up and said I just bought the domain name gimlet Media dot

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
com then we all went to the swanky New York Athletic Club bar and had around a game

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
with lime sugar and gin They were

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
delicious and I wish I could tell you that what happened next was easy but it wasn't

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
mainly because of me and my tortured relationship to the naming process on the way home doubts already started

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
to creep in was it right to have another company name our company that somehow violate the spirit of

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
starting your own

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
company. I went on a flurry of rethinking talking with everyone I could frantically coming up with alternatives

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
to get in line the next day I came into the office and told Matt it just wasn't right we couldn't do it

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
having a professional firm name our startup we needed a more organic path. I thought Matt was

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
going to cry.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
This is a good name he said we like it and more to the point lexicon already did a very time consuming and

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
expensive trademark search for us but I couldn't stop waffling and second guessing

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
was finally calmed me down was a

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
visit to my old workplace the Planet Money offices as their own business and I wrote my old friends and colleagues

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Kwok Truong buoy David Kestenbaum and Jacob Goldstein and talking through my anxieties with me again.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Them around and I told him the name

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
gimlet sure easy to spell.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Like Mad Men

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
sex. I'm OK I'm

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
OK at the time when we came up with that like we

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
were like that's the one Gimblet it's got like. It's like it's like

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
simple but it's just a kid it's like it had all these like associations say sounds like

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
fun but then I was feeling like if it's going to be sort of like a random

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
association word.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
It feels lame to have somebody else come up with it.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
That that doesn't matter who came up with it it's the past. Right like once your company is a company. It's

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
going to be great and it's just going to be the name and nobody's going to care who came up with it and if your company fails it will matter either.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
I know I know that to be the case but it also feels like I have like a gigantic hit in

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
my stomach and a way that this feels like high stakes and like the way nothing else. Things

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
like like Tumblr is weird but I don't even think about what it means or whether it's weird or not or whatever

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
I just think of it as the thing right. The emptier it is the better it is you can be anything you

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
want the point tickets rate is going as it's

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
empty gimlets a blank screen you project whatever you want to right now you're projecting your anxiety

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:24.000
about naming it but like once the show goes off like it will just be what your company is doing.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
They are Gods pay almost two grand to do a full trademark

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
search this time the results came back clear we are now gimlet media.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
I'm honest I'm still getting used to the name and maybe you hate it maybe love

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
it but our job replace the gimlet media that's in your mind right now with the

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
gimlet media that we're going to

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:51.000
build

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Coming up scenes from the next episode of start up. But first a word from our sponsors.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Sort of each year's modern equity management for power. But companies from formation

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
to I.P.O. the shares keep your cap table updated they can issue stock options and

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
other securities entirely like trying to flee.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000
So you don't have to worry about more paper out of date spreadsheets and as your company grows.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
You'll need a four zero nine a valuation.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
That's right this advertisement is about a company that provides for own nine a valuations never saw that coming.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Each share the largest for zero nine a provider in the country shares is the standard

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
silicon valley with major venture capital firms like Andresen hard with an S. enjoy using e shares to

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
help them manage their portfolios monthly pricing as low as ninety nine dollars a

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
