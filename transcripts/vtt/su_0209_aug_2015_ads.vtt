Hey hey have you gone crazy yet are you done.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm calling to say that we can open the show

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
together and I want to know how your vacation is going. I'm sitting in

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
your little cottage for that three year old daughter in my left

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
its mark and he said I

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
say.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So if you are sitting with your children.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You might want to consider who's going to listen because there are some explicit

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
language from gimlet You're

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
listening to start up the podcast about what it's really like to start a business. I'm Lisa Chow.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Alex Bloomberg is on vacation this week and this is episode nine the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
penalty to the season. Traditionally the episode where stuff starts getting really down

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to the wire and things get as bad as these ever been so we're going to

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
follow that tradition and start with this an email or an typed up late one Friday

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
night in Feb twenty fifth

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
teen diorama I've been debating sending this email tonight because I

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
know email isn't the best medium for these kinds of

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
thoughts but I'm sort of freaking out. So here goes. We're going

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to run out of money. We have twenty one thousand and our account. And are about to run payroll

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
of twelve thousand will probably make another five to ten thousand this month which

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
means the horn talks about a lot of things in this email how despite all the

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
improvements they've made in their service they're still not attracting more

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
users how the odds of getting a big investment a V.C. money seem smaller and

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
smaller and how she's run out of ideas. OK Well I'm sorry for

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
this email and where companies

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that. I believe in are a founders and in our team.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But it's just hard right now to believe in our

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
business today on the show

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
how dating ring got to this point to a place where things were so bad the company was

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
a sensually on the verge of bankruptcy and how this little e-mail led

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the day during founders to a big decision moment that changed the course

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
of

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:02.000
their company.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Dating rings money problems really started a couple months

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
back after the relaunch of the business in October twenty fourth

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and we talked about that moment in a previous episode. Initially it seemed that the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
relaunch would be a success that new customers would show up in droves. But

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
after an initial bump the number of new customers slowed to a

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
trickle one of the matchmaker surely. Noticed what was going on simply by

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
looking at the number of matches should be assigned to make each

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
week right after the launch she'd had two

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
hundred and then with every week your section would go down a little bit

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and then a little bit more and then a little bit more but then when you get down to

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
like forty matches in your queue for the week it's

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the startling

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
difference to never OK So I'm curious you never started looking for a job. I

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
never started looking for a job I mean I'm going to tell you everyone told me to look for a job and everyone like you are

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
nuts because I'd be like maybe like Harry. Has your company didn't

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
like to terrible like Mighty Mike amazing real bad you know

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
like no. No new members come in it seems like we're really

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
like getting down

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
there around this time they got some more bad news. Craig

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Lauren's boyfriend and dating ring's only engineer had decided to leave the

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
company he was underpaid and the company just couldn't afford to give him the salary he could be

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
making somewhere else and this was huge you can't run a tech company without

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
any tech people but when I asked Lauren about this. She tried to play it off like it was no big deal.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I figured it was best and if you get a job that can pay more money and where he could

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
have friends to family guy in our company and he would just sit working in the bedroom all day.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So I was sad.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So OK so so so the idea is he's going to be full to full time for a couple more

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
months and then he's going to transition part time and take a full time job elsewhere.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Yes And then also help us five months. Once we have enough

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
money if I ever choose to be fulltime You can hear the doubt and more and force.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
For weeks. I watched Lauren Emma do this awkward dance.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
They were trying to put on a good face for the outside world and then behind the scenes they were

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
packing bailing water out of their sinking ship of a company trying to fix all these

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
problems in February twenty fifth teen four months after the relaunch

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
with revenue flat and users flat and almost no money in the bank.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Lauren flew to California to go to a networking event. She was there looking for potential

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
investors and also some advice answers.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
She didn't know what more she could do and at this event she ran into one of her old advisors from Y.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Combinator Kevin

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Hale Lorne recorded this audio diary on the train after meeting with

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
him he is out now thanks for telling him I was like you

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
know take the not so great average film so

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
great but I still work out. I came so close to

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
your frying pan as it were came to him and I

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
really just wanted to

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
ask like he would leave enough. Are we is this what it looks

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
like when I'm failing and about

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
dieting and basically he says

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
like you're in conference mode and cockroaches dumb a good term unless he is

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
like people to rush to die and work hard and are

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
scrappy but he is like you know the company only dies when you give

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
us an order but like you for that kind of

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
stuff they

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
can

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
but it's like giving up because mom pay your bills and you don't want to farm of

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
money in a car

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and it feels like we have a little so they can use a

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
place a really great beginning of

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
a story or a correlation.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Everything is gone wrong and there's ten thousand left in the bank and

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
magically this house that's

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
really what I

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
don't like I think we're just going to run out of

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
nothing like most people still get most don't compass like

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.000
a

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
logical time when they're right under the law there and get the

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
same for our money like

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
gravity and it was

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
on this trip to California that worn route that Milt and. That we heard at the top of

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
the show so

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
there are ways of being a stable company are raising money or having

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
any engineers working for a number that made roll in April we probably won't.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
money when Lauren go back to New York things had

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
gotten even worse. Lauren and Emma decided they couldn't afford to pay themselves anymore.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
They stopped taking. Salaries and started looking for other jobs to help pay their bills and get them

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
through this tough time morn told my producer Lisa Pollak that she even reached out to an

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
old

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
employer one she had had when she was in

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
college I sat my computer and emailed my former tutoring

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
boss to see if there were any jobs I could take on and I had left

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
this company I was with them maybe six years five or six years a subring Company

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
A and I laughed. Because I was like oh like I'm going to fight how many there are going to you know

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
the S. to have C.E.O. It definitely was swollen

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
pride being back to where I was

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
before

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
for months at Y.C. and afterwards had been drilled into more and you can

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
do that you made it into an extremely exclusive club of startups

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
founders and your job is to grow your company to extraordinary heights.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
It's a total slog. And it may take a while but this is a start

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
up life but Lauren was starting to

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
wonder if this was life she really wanted. She

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
was tired of working around the clock tired of being scared desperate and getting

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
rejected over and

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
over again publicly

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
failing shutting down the CO It seemed like that's where things were going

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
but there was one other option one other way to turn dating ring around

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
it was an

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
easy decision a decision mornin Emma would never have imagined when they packed their

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
bags for Y. Combinator over a year

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
ago becoming up. We find out what that last resort and why

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
it's at the heart of a big debate that's coming up after this word from our

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:59.000
sponsors

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
start at the spa. Answered by Ford Motor Company where acoustic engineers spent more than one hundred

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
hours to name the Explorer platinum audio system.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
You do adjustments inside the vehicle then you listen then you come

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
out you come back you listen again you do more adjustments come back

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
out and it's continuous until it's the best acoustics

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
that you're going to get inside of that vehicle.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Djoko Saudi's audio system supervisor at Ford the goal to reproduce the sound

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
quality of concert halls in Amsterdam Berlin

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Vienna Julius team will sit in the car and listen to every possible kind of music

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
his favorite is classic rock but there are other genres. I won't name names that

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
he hates but listens to. Anyway.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Yes So when we are doing the evaluations and listening to

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
the range of the ball human novel title we want to

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
match you will. Wow Do you have to listen to music that you don't like

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
at maximum

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
volume

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
absolutely do you go home with a headache

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
forward turning your car into a concert hall.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
That is also sponsored by audible with over one hundred eighty thousand audiobook titles. I

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
talked with audible subscribers Matthew and J.C. Abbot from Amarillo Texas when they're dating.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Matthew was living in Austin and had to make long drives to see J.C. one of the drives

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
he

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
discovered it was like a late night trip and I needed to stay awake for the seven and a

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
half hours so I use this credit. And got it. Neil Gaiman's

Welcome

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
back to start up. I'm Lisa Cho and we left off more than Emma were in a

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
bad place and they realized they had one more option for saving their

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
company they could essentially give up on the dream that had led them to start the company in the

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
first place the dream the first pitched from the stage at Y. Combinator.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Didn't work. Like Wilbur I was

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
stating it. There is going to be a

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
billion dollar company that provides. On the mandate and dating right is going to

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
be that company. Thank

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
you at the time Lauren made this pitch from the stage at

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Y.C. she and Emma were all in on the Mark Zuckerberg sweepstakes that

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
they were just building a company they were building a revolutionary company that had

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
the potential to append the status quo and get massive in the

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
process but now roughly one year later they were at a spot where the

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
only way to survive would be to give up that dream and become what's known in

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
the startup world as a lifestyle company. This idea of a

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
lifestyle company came up in season one of

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
startup and I'm going to replay that for you this is Alex talking with one of

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
gimlets investors.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Chris aka what exactly is a lifestyle business.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.000
What

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:37.000
do you not rowing early to really.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Draw a reasonable salary.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
A lifestyle business looks pretty good to a lot of people.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
See this is why I'm stressed out talking to

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
you in ministers like Chris aka. Who put money into companies like

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
her and Twitter and Facebook. They want to see big growth and in

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Chris soccer's world lifestyle companies are not exciting and they're not exciting

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
for investors that Y. Combinator either.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
In fact the conventional wisdom at Y.C. is that to be a startup you can't by

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
definition be a lifestyle company. Here's Lauren talking to my producer Lisa Pollock.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
If you had gone to Y.C. and talked at Y.C. about how I

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
don't know maybe this is going to be a lifestyle

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
business. What would the people around you have

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
said I think they would have said why are you here. Cole.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
But like why are you why see. I mean I think the feeling would be that you're not cut out

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
for the big

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
leagues and that you're not as ambitious.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
I mean I mean I think you have a lot of people who did run successful leftfield companies and now they're at the next level

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
like being at the Olympics and people talking about. You know doing

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.000
well

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
unlike their club or plea. You don't talk

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
about that you're the one

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
fix

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
your job. The startup world you're looking to run the hyper growth

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
company that are so magical that people are willing to hope to have a million.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
I mean and the raising a billion

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
dollars and they're deciding this new future. So people

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
get really caught up in that. And that's the new game

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
that's the new That's the sexy thing to do and

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:45.000
something everyone thinks that lifestyle businesses are shitty It's just not in the game.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
You're either in the game or you're not in the game and over the last year they'd

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
realize that maybe taking dating ring out of the game would be the best way to build

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
their

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
business and so week after Lauren sent that email she read at the beginning of the show.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
A conversation over Skype about what they should do next. Lauren at the time was

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
in California about to pitch a potential investor the pitch about how dating

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
was poised to become a massive game changing company.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Emma was in New York about to get on a plane to go out and join more and they talked for

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
a while about what they need to say in this pitch and how far it felt from

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
reality and they arrived at a pivotal decision they recorded the

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
call. How much more we are going

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
to get fast like. We are going

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000
to you know I think I think I should cancel meetings.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Do you

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
really

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
say you know we think we're going to be like obviously you feel weird

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
about taking your time or your money in

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
that I don't miss working on a

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
job to me like a minute. OK OK.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
They were supposed to pitch this investor name call and the very next day. Lauren finished typing and read the

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
email aloud to

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Emma I

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
had high call and then apologize for a last minute

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
notice but I unfortunately have to camp fire meeting to

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
say after much thought and a careful review of Q one financials we have

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
decided not to continue fundraising after eighteen months iterating. We still

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
have not found product markets and Eudora current financial status we can no longer afford

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
to keep our C.T.O. on full

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
time our clear path to Rick profitability is by focusing solely on

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
a premium matchmaking that is going to our main goal moving

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
forward as such we do not feel that it would make sense for us to continue fundraising while we do not have a

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
clear path toward scalable and sustainable growth.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.000
I

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
feel

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:35.000
like

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:55.000
I

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:46.000
know

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
taken

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
I

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
spoke

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
to

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
them

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
a

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
couple

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
days

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
after

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
the

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
meet

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
the

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.000
call

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
we had like officially decided Saturday night I was really down because we had like sort of officially tired of it all I'm not trying to California like we're not going to fish about like this whole thing is sort of over you know it's like if you apply a college and you know it's your reach and you know like you're probably not going to get it and be like some sort of picture help going there like what and I can't bend them like. You know in the new That's third action letter and you're like no I'm not going to say goodbye to all those like fantasies you've had and all the dreams you've had about it even if you like sort of knew it was a long shot. You have to give up that dream in your head what. What did that fantasy look like if you could kind of give me a sense of like what did success kind of look like under that scenario. You know if it looked like telling people the name of. My company and having them know what it was. Having it be something that that that impacted people in some way why.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
So what do you think success looks like under this new scenario

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000
as a lifestyle business.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.000
I

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
well what I'm going to say to make it sound like I didn't think this about the other but I guess I guess that

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
wasn't part of the image but now it feel like doing a good job being a good

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
matchmaker

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
and making enough money to not worry about making

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000
payroll and pay myself.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Silly I think is what it looks like.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
It felt like the right decision but of course it wasn't easy giving up the idea of being a

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
huge tech company. It was the idea that carried them through I see the thing be pitched

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.000
on demo

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
day and in all those investor meetings and giving it up was sort of

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
like giving up their identity. Lorne was demoralized and

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
when founders are going through tough

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
times family members are often the ones who bear the brunt of the ups and

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
downs be it emotionally or financially Lauren's parents for example

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
had invested thousands of dollars in dating ring.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
It also lent Lauren money to help her get through times when she wasn't taking a salary but she didn't feel

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
like she could tell them what was really going on with the

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
business admitting failure to investors or advisors was one thing telling your mom.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:09.000
That's

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
another I remember the beginning telling her I was like I'm going to make a company worth ten million

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
dollars and.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I was used to doing what I told them I would do like I'm

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
gonna go to a good college and I'm going

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
to do well in classes. And I just I

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
felt like I had failed and. I

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
guess it and mainly

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
most and barest when it came to my parents.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
It seemed like I was admitting

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
this this huge failures that they'd had they hadn't seen

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
coming as far as Lauren's mom knew. Lauren was still trying to build a

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
giant dating company and from the outside it seemed like things were going well dating ring had been in

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
the York Times. On into I.C. they were chosen to be featured on this pod

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
cast and so when Lauren asked to borrow money. Her mom just thought of it as a way to help.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Lauren get through the tough times that all start to go through and Lauren thought she'd be able to pay the money

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
back but as the business struggled to pay her mom became more difficult.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Warren felt like she'd broken a

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
promise she didn't know how to tell her mom the truth about what was going on with the

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
business but then one day around the time Lauren and Emma made the decision to become a

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
lifestyle company. Lauren was home visiting her mom and they got into it. Lauren switched

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
on the

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
recorder what reasoning. So that

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
he can you a question about the different beach running

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
a final

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
and more not she knew where the conversation was going she expected her mom to ask about

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
money or say she was disappointed or tell Warren to get a real job

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
but instead learn her thing she never heard from her mom

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
before and you think oh no we are not the way that we plan

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
on it you know the rest.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
You know I think that story out

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
of all I was always a great speaker and that and always happy where I

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
was you know I admire you are

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
willing to try

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
to apply for staying on

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
the field but even things don't always the way I'd

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
like but I'm still proud

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.000
of

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:50.000
the storyboarding to yeah.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
I guess for some people a bit like of course your mom simulate Oh you're great everything's going

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
well. But your mom's not that way.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Not in a bad way but

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
she she's not like overly It's not like every week she calls me and tells me I'm

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
the best person ever like I know but like sheerly has a mom like

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
that.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
You know my mom my mom's more reserved. I would

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
say snow. So this this

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:39.000
monologue and I really took it to heart.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.000
So

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
once

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
you've made this momentous decision. Switching from the number of data to a simple

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
matchmaking service. One of the first steps is to announce it to your staff on a

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Monday morning. Emma another matchmaker sitting in the New York office.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Lauren and the other staff members were on Skype. They had gotten them all together to

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
tell them we're a new company now here's an

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
A and we know that we have the team we know we have the resources we know what we're good and we know that we can

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
be something really great and so the next few months are really going to be

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
spent transitioning the company to being a

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
really strong matchmaking service which which we can be and and we

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:35.000
are definitely have at least halfway there.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Coming

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
