OK

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
so

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
what were two words you know about mystery belt buckle.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That is a good title

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
for that Carson. He knew me even before I was

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
solving mysteries. That's how far back we go when you have a mystery

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
you carry it around with you always Usually that happens in your head but in

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Carson's case. His mystery fits in the palm of his

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
hand it's an object that came into his life when he was nine years old in Phoenix Arizona.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
There is this kid in our neighborhood named Jimmy Turk who was like maybe a year older than

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
my brother is to. Years older than me and. He was like a troublemaker

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I wouldn't go so far as a calm a bad kid but like you know he had a single mom. So

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
he could get away with more stuff than me and my

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
brother because he had to work and so he just had a lot of fun

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.000
supervised

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
time likable affable troublemaker. Yeah good guy

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
yeah he never really did anything that bad you know it was just like I

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
remember he had like found a stick of dynamite somewhere and he'd emptied out all the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
gunpowder from the stick of dynamite. Supposedly the stick of dynamite was never

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
seen again about or with the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
in one

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
day he went over to Jimmy's

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
house and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
he showed me this belt buckle that he'd found in the gutter. That was what

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
he said he went for a walk and found it in the gutter and

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
it's

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
beautiful on the front of it there's a chef's hat front and center flanked

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
by a corkscrew pan of eggs that are

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
frying in a toaster and the pan

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
of eggs like eggs are painted you know like very carefully with some kind of

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
an animal. So they're like yellow and

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
white and this is the coolest part of

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
it you ready.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Yeah. That is the toaster.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
No yeah there's a tiny tiny switch and if you flick the switch

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the toast pops

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
up. There's a little tiny toast that comes out.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Yeah a little tiny toast like this is big as your pinky nail they have like

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
a crust and then bread texture on the bread and then you can push them right back down.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
It is it is the coolest belt buckle I've ever seen.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Think back to when you were a little kid how badly you wanted to bleed the world that's full of

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
hidden treasures.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Now imagine taking that belt on.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I was hypnotized. Yeah and you should have

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
been and I just sat there I think in his bedroom playing with

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
the for half an hour just popping the toes putting it back to the point where his mom

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
took him out of the hallway and was like you know Carson love that. Thing so much.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I think you should give it to what he say he says but he gave it to me and uses the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
yeah you're right and there's a hymn and you can have that you don't really care about it

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
like well you know he was like you

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Dynamite girl stuff. Why do you get girls in you to you're too

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
young too young too

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
tiny obsessed with miniature

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
toasters

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
every last object comes with a mystery but seems hopelessly impossible to solve

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
the single glove found in the train the wedding band found on the beach but the

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
belt buckle was different it came with clues on either side of the

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
buckle was the

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
name the name on the for is Hans Jordy H A N

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
S J O R D. And then the name on the back it says

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
in appreciation. Bob six B O B S I X.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Hans Jordy Bob six. They were the kind of names the demanded to be etched

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
in the Silver who was Hans Jordy what did Bob six appreciate him

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
for Carson as a theory which he inherited from his

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
that my dad's theory which is funny just because he said it

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
it stuck with me Bob six is like a cowboy. He's like organize

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.000
these

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
like trail rides for like older guys in their forty's and

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
then they go on the trail and have breakfast to get drunk in Han's with there's

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
the cook and he was a blast and they all of them.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Bob six is just wealthy enough that he had this bubble homemade

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
form.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I started to feel guilty because there's a name on it that I should get

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
this bill but go back to him or to his kids or

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
somebody but normally when you find stuff like in you know this stuff. There's dozen thrift

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
stores that are you know filing a picture next month wedding album and the urge is

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
not usually to return it. Why have you felt the urge to return it at

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
all because it's not a it wasn't found in the store it was found in a

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
gutter the last thing you

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
know I just thought that it's the right thing to do.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
How do you imagine he

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
lost your job if you do so I will figure it

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
out

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
What do you want to

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
find Hans and Bob six what you want to tell

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
them. I want to say sorry I didn't get back to you sooner but I mean

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
do you ever want to spend your leisure time I guess you do.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I would find one Shorty. And Richard buckle to

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
him even though this case made my stomach hurt a little

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
the buckle was that rarest of things an object as enchanting

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
an actuality as it was as a story. What were the chances

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
that the real life hons

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Jordi and the real life Bob

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
six would be that two I wasn't in the preserving Limousin wonder business

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
though I was in the mystery solving business and I had my work cut out for

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
me there are so many gaps to fill in for example I already

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
knew Honda's position on miniature toasters.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
But nothing at all about how he felt about regular night

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000
one

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
closes Donna. This is my name is Star Lee and I was calling to ask you

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
a question about an art class that you

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
teach Do you remember a student named

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Hans Jordi.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Oh you are gone. Jordy are marathons joining you

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
do

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
this in Don appears I discovered a newspaper idea written ten years ago about

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
a seaside painting class in San Diego that Donna had taught the class had been

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
free and it taking place on the beach. Donna gave lessons on how to paint the

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
horizon included in the article is a group photo showing the

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
student who had taken the class that day and in that photos caption third from the

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
left is the name pond. George. So I

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
called on up to see if her home Georgie with cartoons on

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
George you know I had I don't know maybe a couple thousand

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
people come to those classes and I remember hands more than I

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
remember What do you remember about him

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
in your letter he was an interesting student.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I didn't like them all I think I was very happy to see him in my class

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
in the photo accompanying the caption is grainy the students are crouching on

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
the sand holding their campuses. There's only one man in the photo who I assume

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
is Hans he's wearing a hat and mere timeless' I know a

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
disguise when I see one and ask Donna for a better description of

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Hans I can see here. I can see his body.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
I can see him drawing I can see him sitting in my class. I can hear his voice I

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
can hear the sound of his voice actors are you seeing the like this

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
German actors that usually plays like a father Carlo

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
or like an intro carnage. And he has that kind of a

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
look I could picture but not a skinny face

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
guy with a Monaco and main face with a monocle like a rounded face. We go.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
No we're all kind of

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
monocle you know our thing was perfect for that are very good.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000

That's the guy.

This is the guy you were using this guy before I don't think is the guy I think now that you're

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
seeing him you decided he's a guy but I don't like this guy was in your head.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
desk sitting behind a desk. OK I'm looking. That's the vibe that Hans that.

Thanks

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
to Donna I now had a description of Hans

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Doherty conjoin he was Swiss

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
German on short he was

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
memorable on Shorty with greatness on Avalon and robbed of his Oscar in the film

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Shine but I still didn't know what accounted for

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
the shaft on the

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
buckle it couldn't just be random.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I asked Ana if her Hanta been a chef.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
She said she didn't know because she hated to

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
cook which I had to admit was air tight logic.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I'd have to decipher this clue some other way I did my first witness goodbye.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Any time you come to California in the mail and I meet somewhere and I'll

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
actually show. You had to do sense really hard. Sounds like

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
that over the phone without the visuals that go with it

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
I appreciate that I never know I want to know how to feel horizon

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
where we're gonna. One thing that you can do is if you have a.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
This Hold

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
it right on your nose. What you see is above the pen and that's what you

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
see and then and then the Panopticon could go out there or something

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and then took your whole head down so that you

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
say the pen from the bottom. You know. Of the

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
line and with the glass up so that you think about the

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
band you would have gotten

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
that I'd like you're telling me a new way of seeing whether glass is half full or half

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
empty half. This is going to

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
change everything for

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:11.000
me

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.000
my

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.000
next

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
lead. I found on the food

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
blog called The Faded epicure on April fourteenth two thousand and ten the

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
sated epicure had written about a meal he'd had to walk a long ago memory from his

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
earliest days as a cook

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
post said quote In one thousand nine hundred sixty. I was on my internship at a casino in Lake

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Tahoe and tasted my first classical beef dobe prepared a chef on

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Jordi at sixty six chef pond was so

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
tall they had to take a chef hat off to walk around the

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
kitchen his stride was wider than the wingspan of a small aircraft and he

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
spoke as fast as he

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
walked and loved a chef

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
so tall that he grazed the ceiling with a stride wider than

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
the wingspan of a small aircraft

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
that's the language. To describe a superhero not a human man could it be

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
possible that the real life hons Jordi with even more fantastic than the

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
one Carson had imagined as a kid maybe I wasn't preserving when the in

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
wonder business. I rotated epicure and told him we had to talk.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
I was nineteen when I first met Hogg in walks this

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
guy fifty years old starched perfect chef

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
whites and he takes us running through the main kitchen with these

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
eighty gallon steam kettles going with soups and stocks all these various sauces

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
and chowders things happening all at once people dicing and chopping and noise and steam

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
and he disses the main

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
kitchen boom and then he swings back through the stairway and he's taken

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
two or three stairs at a time he's flying and we're tripping down the stairs behind him all seven

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
of us bumping into each other and I'm like oh my gosh he's at least twice my age and I

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
can't keep up with the

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
guy twice. Well everything

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
twice as fast in the kitchen and twice as capable of putting out two thousand dollars a pop twice is

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
capable of standing on his fetal two in the morning on a twenty hour shift twice is capable

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
about being in the next morning at four like nothing ever happened twice is capable of having a

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
spotless white Jeffco while I was covered from head to

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
toe and I know that sounds a bit overboard

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
but it's the truth.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
My stomach was hurting again faded kept bringing up conscious chef

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
white how perfectly starched and spotless sale is where it was hard for me to

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
imagine Carson's buckle fitting into then sambal I tell faded about

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
the buckle and describe for him the panic bags the corkscrew the toaster pops

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
up when you hear that does that sound like

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Hans it jogged a memory in my mind of

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
us seeing him for the first time in civilian

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
clothes back then when you got your paycheck. They. Put

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
three drink tokens in your paycheck. So we're sitting at the bar after getting our

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
paychecks consuming our three free drinks when we see

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
hogs

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
and it's like reverse Superman. You know quite Kent coming out of the booth After

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
changing into his

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
regular attire. We didn't recognize him at first remember saying

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
to burn him Mike. That's

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Hans that is not Mike I swear to god that Tom's Watch he's going

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
to walk toward us. He's in this this white sort

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
of that's me

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
looking Sure he's got CA boy's boots and jeans

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and he walks towards us kind of nods and keeps going and I

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
said oh my God he's a Swiss

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:59.000
cowboy

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
you ever see him again in plain clothes

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
no never know there's a reason I saw him then and it's thirty years later that I

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
know why we didn't catch him coming out of that door that one time I would have

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
been no use to you in that

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
county funny had nothing to do with it was

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Satan destined to be a clear that help me solve my mystery is that really how fate

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
works but was that simply how drink coupons work in

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
faded life that actually wasn't the only time Fate had converged with

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Hans I was in a situation where we were we were running out of tuitions money.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
I come from a working class family. Nobody ever went to college. Either I

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
get scholarship money to continue or I need to withdraw from college. We had

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
nothing left we had nowhere to go.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
In order to get the scholarship faded had to get an A from Hans he didn't tell Hans about the

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
scholarship or financial problems at all and he didn't hold out much hope of getting into

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
a Hans seemed to

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
be. So perfect and everything that had very little tolerance for the limitations

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.000
of mere

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
mortals still faded had to try. He worked so

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
hard after two months faded returned home knowing he was a better

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
chef but doubtful that he was still a college student he met with his advisor who

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
told him Hans had given him an A

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
even his advisor was surprised he told faded hons never gave A's.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I was told in June that I had gotten the A and that I had received a full

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
scholarship including housing for the following year went back so happy in

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
September when a new batch of teaching assistants started my wife to be was in that group.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
So if you might not have met her if you hadn't gone back to

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
school I would never of matter that's the whole point. It's one of those either

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000
or events in life that we experience every day you either get it all or you get nothing.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
This one I want. I got the it

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
happened. That's my point and I didn't just meet my wife she's my soulmate. I

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
mean like really unusually great marriage.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
If I hadn't earned

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000
a that could have never happened. However there's no way.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
You know. Hans was that that

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:26.000
piece

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
my conversation with Satan had filled out my profile hons quite

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
nicely on Jordy was a cowboy slash

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
F slash superhero slash manipulator of space and

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
time

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
and while we're on the subject of space and

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
time faded hadn't seen or spoken with Hans since his internship

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
ended that was in one thousand nine hundred seven. I needed more reason and

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
tone which came to me be a message board posting on a site

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
called Web food Pros dot com the subject heading of the. Message was

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
this looking for Hans

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Jordi

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
the message with one thousand nine hundred eight and it been posted by a man named chef Carr who

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
wrote Swiss chef Hans Jordi has been missing from my address book for

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
years I searched online and he doesn't exist

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
there help exclamation point

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
please exclamation point. I stared at the

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
message suspiciously. I was looking for Hans

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
GA How many belt buckles had this guy

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:50.000
lost

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
when Hello.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
I found a chef Karl who owns a restaurant in Houston and called him

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
up. We were all working in the Biltmore Hotel. I started in sixty two

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
there and he was the sushi chef that I mean actually it was the style

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
that the

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
first chef call new hands and they were both starting off a chef

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
and cooking at one of the swank is joint in Phoenix the Biltmore Hotel and so you guys were like

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.000
really

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
close really close we were all European crew

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
that's why you know the stock to get. You still like on the song the

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
nights when they were finished work and there was much time around nine

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
o'clock and. The whole crew actually went up to a bowling

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
alley undeliverable until about three or four o'clock in the morning.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
All at the start of war and they like walk in the morning.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Was he a good bowler you have some good games and then you have some lousy especially when it's

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
a New

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Year's chef Carl's looking for one Jordy posting had been a

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
bust it didn't help him find

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Han's mainly this had to do with Chef Karl never logging on to the site again if

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
he had he would have seen. This comment from a man named Schaeffer ne Hi Carl.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000
I know Hans last time I saw him he was working for a hotel in Scottsdale Arizona.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
You should call Bob

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
bland. I read shepherdess message to Chef Karl over the phone he knew

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Bob land and agreed he was a good

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
lead robber land in the sixty's he wants the

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
vegetable oil and he's still so more

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
incentives eating they could tell

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
you let's contemplate for a moment the name Robert Plant.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
What kind of name was that for a chef.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
No wonder he had to use a pseudonym. I pulled out my notebook and

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
wrote Bob bland equals Bob six

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.000
period when the question Did Bob bland have a nickname.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
They just on

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Bobby I added a hook above the period so that it became a question

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
mark anywhere little with you one thing. OK And maybe I might use some of this on

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
the show but never.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Meanwhile my phone with blowing up with text from my client wanting an update.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
I'm kind of too interested for Smalltalk to be just my job

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
and I mean yeah. The feeling that I can talk about these days anyway. So what you

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
want to know whose hands You're already. He's a chef also the

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
great chef with the soul of a cowboy. That's what my dad thought I know

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
your dad was right.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Oh and I I know Bob Six's was Bob six.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
He's a man named Bob land. Oh wow and what does he do. He's a chef.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
So does Bob blame to go by Bob six just because Bob Bland is the worst name for a chef.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Maybe I don't know why he goes by Bob sick

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
yet but I knew how I'd find out. Carl had told

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
me that Bob land still lived in Phoenix and sure enough I discovered there was even

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
a competition called the Robert Plant colon

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Isilon put on by a Phoenix calling area so she. On its website with the page that listed all

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
its members had made donations to one hundred the

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
names for the top of the first column I

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:17.000
planned

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
short the association had a board meeting coming

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
up it could not

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
be more clear when I had to do it was time to return

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
to where it came

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:39.000
from Looked like I was going to Phoenix.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Let's take a quick

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:56.000
break

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.000
support

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
for

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
mystery show. Such as the kind dark

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:09.000
chocolate bar which brings me to this week's installment of the ingredients.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
I made

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
except little kids can't pronounce cinnamon. I mean as I can say one

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000
like three or four quintessential kids can't say words cinnamon comes to mind.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
So we just have kids trying to save for thirty

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
seconds. Send them

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:37.000
in

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
hard

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:52.000
word or an easy word even three years old.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Firetruck the kind you can stay tuned for the

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
next installment of the ingredient list. And do the kind thing for your

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
world and

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
me here is a plan. I was to fly to

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Phoenix to return Honda's buckle to him but before I could do that I

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
needed to get it from the person who kept it safe for all these years in a

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
special place where you call it the job. I was trying to be

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
a polite person go through the hall

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
closet and comes back with a large tin.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
I'm going to drop the good stuff at the bottom. Much

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000
like your theory

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
about how hands got the buckle Carson storage system for it came from his dad

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
to my dad he had these like junk collections when he was a kid that has now

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
become our junk collections that are just. Like

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
every tiny object that we book accumulated through our

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
youth in other words it's a scrap bucket.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
That's in the lens Castle those are arcade.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
That's from homecoming making ninety

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
six heifers girlfriend's underpants. This was all you had a rose.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000
She gave belt buckles definitely the crown jewel.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Well obviously it was in the bottom of the scrap bucket after all

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
how do you feel about letting it

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
go fine with that.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Yeah I mean I think the part of me that wouldn't be OK with that is like a part of

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
me that I want to

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
kill it wasn't made for me you

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
know it's the hardest belt buckle. I've had it for twenty seven

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
years time. Yeah I think it's time I can't

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:04.000
wait

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:04.000
I

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
slip the buckle and my backpack on the flight to Phoenix. I keep the bag on my lap.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:09.000
The whole

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000
time and even then check constantly that the buckle still in there.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
After all these years it be so like me to lose

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:42.000
and

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:42.000
I'm

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
at fortieth Street and Calibra this is where the buckle is found by

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Jimmy

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Turk the Phoenix calling Area Association meeting. I was hoping Bob six would be

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
at it wasn't for another day.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
So in the meantime I decided to pursue another of the buckles

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
mystery how it. Asked it maybe I'd get lucky and spot

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
an obvious clear

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
by like a belt buckle factory.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Hey

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
why just walk around the corner I'm looking at Dental specialty. Yeah and I'm looking at a

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.000
cupcake

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
place.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
OK.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
I didn't know exactly what to expect Colonel Jimmy Turk would be like.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000
But at the very least I thought he treat me with a little stick of dynamite in his hand.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Instead he was trying to keep his voice at a whisper. So as not to wake a sleeping

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
daughter Emily less so mommy that Darley say hi.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
In retrospect he probably wasn't talking to

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
me I wonder if I could pull in that they're just

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
parked in cars and version. Jimmy had found the buckle in

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
the gutter which to me had made its own sorta sense like a gutter is where lost

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
or unwanted things wash up.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Instead we're standing on a sidewalk next to a busy four way intersection on the

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
outskirts of Phoenix subdivision who would have thought an object this

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
unique could be found on the street this aggressively familiar.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
I don't know where I was going or what I was doing but were coming down and just happened to see

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
it like

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
right right over by the bushes right over here I remember just

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:27.000
walking

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000
around and.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Finding the right are right next that wall there by the bushes close to the wall closer to

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
the wall than the sidewalk.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Yeah. Definitely Jimmy hasn't seen the buckle since that Dana's room when

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
he gave it to

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Carson and

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:51.000
sure. This post.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Will be interesting to know

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
if he remembers where he

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
left he will know exactly where he left it because if you know you lost something and thought

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
was back and that he did. Go back and I had already found it. Oh wow what

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
if you could just missed each

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
other if Jimmy had walked by any other moment instead of the

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
buckle he would have just found some Swiss guy who young around in the gravel just like a

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
faded hadn't been in that bar that night I wouldn't have known Honda's a

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
cowboy a matter of fact house right

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
here right try to show off and do a backflip but

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
I had my shield and I had some stitches when I was a

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
kid and then that telephone pole down there. I jogged

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
in to dry and teach my grandpa how to jog and I drove right into a telephone pole so that I have

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
two sets of stitches couple questions here.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
How do you teach someone to jog wide and Jimmy grandpa already know how to jog

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
and my grandpa. My dad my uncle and I we all have

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
two sets of stitches about Archon

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
what is a scar in the same place person you told your dad you got

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:04.000
so when he saw your chin did he say like the family line continues.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
What is it with his belt buckle and

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:20.000
fate

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.000
and

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.000
I

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
head

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
to my next point.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
I've arranged to meet chef and the chef who answered chef calls Querrey a web

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
food

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
proto we're meeting in an Italian restaurant that is known for having the best

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
pizza in the country like it's not just people in Phoenix.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
But chef Renee is waiting for me

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
out he recognizes me because of my microphone and I recognize

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
him because the twinkle in ally of someone who is about to help

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
me break this case wide

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
open the order to show people

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
appalled the sheet of paper when I printed out his webpage Pros dot com comment which brought me

00:33:59.000 --> 00:33:59.000
to

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Phoenix. Yes this

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
is Chef Rene doesn't remember writing the

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
post and has no idea who chef Carlists none of

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
which have deterred him from meeting with me.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Apparently helping people who are looking for Hondas Jordi is just sort of His

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
thing was at nineteen I think seventy six when Americans.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
What was what what's what Tom's

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
like here because

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
we're Shepherd A is from

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Ecuador by way of Germany. He was part of a sort of mass migration

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
of European chef to the American Southwest in

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
the fifty's and sixty's. You know when I came to this country

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
in sixty nine and landed in Houston

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Texas a Kosovo's because we

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
have cars and I

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
work hard to support their tax break or to

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
see car was there with you colleagues down the runway

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
a horse would be coming

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
for by now I've grown accustomed

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
to stories of haunted in the past when I'm not used to it what

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Schaeffer tells

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
me that maybe tomorrow we get the ships me the baby of

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
the boat

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
with the ship

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
meeting

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
on the BE THERE.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
OK OK OK I've got a lot of planning to be

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
shepherding says at the meeting tomorrow to pretend not to know so as not to tip

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
on boss.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
I tell him that I want Hans know I'm looking for him.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
That's the whole point Shefrin a give me a look like Don't

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:55.000
worry he can keep a secret.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:55.000
So

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:55.000
I

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
needed to manage the president sends me great questions.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
But back in the day the corner Association of Arizona's gatherings took

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
place in elegant hotels and resorts where the chefs worked there were

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
fancy spread multi-course dinners five ice sculptures. Now the

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
meetings are held pretty much wherever the association can call in the

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000
favor works well over a bridge where there's offices.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
This is not the place is there when the host country clubs

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
sells one

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
of about a dozen chefs are gathered in the conference room. I take

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
a seat next to a man who looks to be in his late sixty's a

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000
great height to toss if anybody has.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
The name of a pastry chef. But would like to work

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
for a big company you know

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
accent German This had to be high and I'd finally

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
found him not being able to work. I look over at the man

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
and smile

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
shyly You know what you would like to do is

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
recognize the members they said the most is the club. Now wait a minute.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
This is a whole different guys around to behave A didn't have

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
to go on this. And then it's gone right.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
I was suddenly kneedeep in elegant European chef's hands

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Jordi could've been half the men there. My hand shoots up. It's a question I do have

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
a question about a particular chef. In Arizona who might be a member think.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Hahn's Jordi do you guys know here we are told he was one of the

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
old guard. Oh yeah sure sure hons

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Jordi no one here to find hand wasn't at the meeting after all but a lot of

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
these guys had seen him not too long ago on his birthday he had

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
a big birthday party. What was his birthday to

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
seven eight.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
His wife invited. People he didn't know

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.000
about

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
it so why don't you people the Old Spice guy you know they know how to party

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000
and how long have you known

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
him in the US You

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
know I mean every year infant daughter wants to go

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
to their

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000
detention. One day it's time

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
to do what we all shuffle to another room. I hear my name

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
called out. It's Chef Rene. He saved a seat for

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
