this that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:20.000
person is now me.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.000
should

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
start from the beginning. Does the beginning mean childhood.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Not that

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
beginning this mystery belongs to my friend

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Jonathan a couple weekends ago I went to the Smithsonian Institute in Washington

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
D.C. rain do any of like the smart things and go see like

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
you know documents. I looked at Dorothy flu is a devises shoes.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Archie Bunker's chair. You know the dumb ass part of him use them.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So I saw that stuff and then ten minutes later I went to the cafeteria to get something the eat.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You've been getting legendarium And did you spend it

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
in museum. I probably spent more time in the cafeteria.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It was a good lunch. And on the way

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
in they have behind glass all of these lunch

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
pails and what caught my eye was the Welcome Back

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Kotter lunchpail sitcom from the seventy's starring gave Kaplan and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
drawn Travolta about a group of four guys. In high school I guessed they

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
were learning

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
disabled or you had risk juvenile delinquent. Yeah they were juvenile delinquents I guess

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
yeah with learning disabilities definitely Arnold for Shaq either had a learning disability

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000
or was just Jewish but back then he was funny and they called him sweat hog.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
was a huge. Welcome Back Kotter fan like I loved it so much and not only did I watch

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
it I used to tape record I had audio tape recorder an ace a tape record

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
episodes and then listen to them again later like as though they were radio plays. Yeah and

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I used to even like memorize lines that our cool that I could use in

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
school like your mom so low that she could play handball against the curb.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
There's a lot of Mother jokes like John Travolta's character Vinnie Barbarino would always

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
say not about memo The Should men murder was a saint remember that. Nope.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Absolutely not I In fact I think I just used that line on you last time I saw you I said hey look

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
you brought up my mother innocent My mother's a saint. I was quoting Vinnie

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Barbarino at this point it seems hard to believe the Johnson ever said anything to me that wasn't

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.000
from Welcome Back

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Kotter so I was studying the scene depicted on the lunch

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
pail and there was something in in the image that

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
made no sense to me and I just stood there for quite a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
while holding my tray full of food just staring at the front

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
page trying to figure out what the what the image

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
was and what I'm going to do is I'm going to summon it up they took

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
a photograph of a photo and Johnson found out that piqued my interest.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I guess you my i Phone I mean I've got. I've only taken maybe four

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
pictures of my niece one of my nephew maybe a picture of a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
parking sign so I remembered where I parked or something and then this Welcome Back Kotter lunchpail I don't

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
want to waste I don't want to waste memory said the man whose childhood memories were filled to capacity.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Welcome Back Kotter OK in the

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
scene you see all four sweat hogs and Mr Carter.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
They're all standing outside a locker bank

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and one Epstein and Vinnie Barbarino look as

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
though they're about to get into a fight and that's the moment that's

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
been the mortal eyes on this on this lunch pail.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So I was like That's really odd one would never fight with

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Barber You know they're all friends so

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I looked at it more closely and I

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
realized one Epstein is holding his

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
jacket which is a good denim jacket a jean jacket a kind

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
of jacket that a juvenile delinquent in the seventy's might wear and

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
the sleeves of the jacket have

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
not taken the sleeve like that like a length of rope or shoe

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
lace and has just tied knots in

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
a

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
jacket in front of Barbara as though it were a

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.000
dead

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
pet Freddie Boom Boom Washington is behind

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
them and Arnold's shack is behind Barber Reno and looks like

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
he's pulling barber you know back. If you need a

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
visual picture one of those huge renaissance painting of Christ being taken down

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
the crown of thorns on his head lifeless body cradled by his

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
disciples like that except instead of

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Christ the teaching jacket with knots in the sleeves.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
What makes it so inscrutable to me is. Was the presence of the

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
sleeve knotted jacket is something I've never have you ever heard of that like jacket sleeve

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
knotting What is that about was that like a thing was that a prank that people pulled in

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
the seventy's.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Jonathan thought museums are places you go to grab a nice lunch turned out they also

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
contain

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
mysteries because I can't find it on the Internet. I looked up all kinds of

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
different

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
permutations knotting jacket

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
sleeves knots in coat sleeves not sleeve

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
joke. The While the knots in the sleeves might have been what most confounded Jonathan. It was

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
the injustice of it that most wanted him millions of years from now when

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.000
the world is turned to

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
dust and nothing but the wild lunchboxes is left standing. This is how

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Welcome Back Kotter will be regarded by future civilizations.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I don't think it's an image taken from the actual T.V. show I think that whoever the artist

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
was who created the

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
picture might never never seen the show and you've seen all the episodes.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Yes the repeat like you have many times over and then also listen to the audio

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
coming up. Yeah I would listen to the audio afterwards. Do you remember the sound of

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
like Denham being told taht

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
put forward that sounds

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
easy and like all the great arm chair lunchbox designers before him. Johnson had some ideas

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
of his own about how it should have gone.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
They could have put pretty boom Washington doing the air base and go boom boom boom boom

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
boom boom boom they could have put Arnold for check raising his hand in going

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
to Barbary no doing the barber you know dance. Why this.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I'm wondering where does this come from.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Was it a thing was it a line national craze like the you know the Charleston the

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
twenty's or something jacket knotting in the seventy's and it's just something lost to us so I'm

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
curious about that and I'm also curious about whoever the artist was who created.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
The picture on the lunch pail

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
whether it was drawn from his own history or something that he

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
just invented

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
wholesale so I am imploring you to get to the bottom of this of this mystery.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Telling him pouring He said only really are imploring men. I'd like you

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
to help me. I'd like you to help me get to the bottom of

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
this as someone who's been in the mystery business for

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
weeks this case frankly seems a little beneath my experience level the not

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
a jacketed probably been on the show and Johnson just forgotten just like he would have

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
forgotten where he parked that one time if he had taken a picture of the space or just like how

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
he'd forgotten to document the rest of his whole entire life.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
But nonetheless agreed to take on his

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
case I'd spend a few hours on it you know a favor for an old pal.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Besides I always have been a sucker for a good

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
imploring

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Welcome Back Kotter was on for four seasons but the last season was shot in one thousand seventy nine and the

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
lunchbox came out in one nine hundred seventy seven that meant a scene could be in season

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
four I was making breastwork this

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
already

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
there were twenty two episodes a season. Each episode twenty four minutes long without

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
commercials that fifteen hundred in eighty four

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
minutes or a little more than one full day I didn't have that kind of time now

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
without it cutting into my watching other television

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
shows saying listen the help of two of my investigators. I told them

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
that ideally they'd find the scene itself but they were to be on the lookout for other clues to

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
anything nodded anything Dennis and

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
of course any pranks high jinks escapades capers antics or

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
larks if there was so much of the banana peel out of place. I wanted to hear about

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
it whatever's going on in

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that picture in the lunch box is way too complicated for the typical

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
plot line. Of Welcome back. Or opposite. Lisa took the first shift season one.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
OK Do they were denim to demo my jacket

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
denim is so pervasive and Welcome Back Kotter now we're getting somewhere when

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
they have to all the extras and this one hogs the room is just a sea of them. I made this

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
OK

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
there's denim jacket denim jeans denim shirt bell

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
bottoms that are denim and there with patches of other kinds of denim there are people who

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
wear outfits where the top is a denim shirt and the bottom is

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
jeans lot of them have jeans with no back pockets. That's weird. Vinnie

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Barbarino has a denim jacket that's actually like I didn't know this is a cruel but it's

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
more like a barn style jacket cut with the bigger pockets. It's like a mom jean jacket.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
You know what I'm saying but he has such a long torso I don't know if I had a choice.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I have to say but it's like the Top Ten Things to sit out to me was the length of John Travolta

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
stories are pranks a significant part of the show. There you have to

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
be there. There are praying. OK so like a typical prank from season one would be

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
like oh we took the signs off the bathrooms we put the sign for girls on

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
the boys bathroom we put a sign for boys on the girls' bathroom. That's a solid prank.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
If you like to watch your season.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Believe me I will wait because first I did check in with

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Eric about his

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
season as far as I can tell the jacket thing never happened in season two. I'm a little

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
afraid that it's going to be a situation where I was like watching it so closely I missed it

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
you know I finished them. I think twelve fifteen at night and I got to the end and I was like.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
All right. I didn't see it

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
did I can see it I'm not sure you

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
know I got really excited and think it's about subsidy

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
maybe the vice principal character was Brummagem through the sweat hogs

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
lockers to get to Bob arena soccer and they opened up and he pulls out

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
a jacket. Michael this is. There's gotta be something here like

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
watched really intently like it was so heavy on the Geralyn close to the screen of that one

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Arlington so close to the stage are nose pressed to the screen was not pressed group that's what

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Washington looks like I'm sorry to avoid them

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
again. It was time for my season Season

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
three by season three the cast of Welcome Back Kotter

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
for some of the biggest stars in the country in interviews from that time the sweat hogs acknowledged the

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000
danger of becoming so famous so young they knew they would be twenty six playing sixteen years old forever.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
The trick to staying relevant Robert Hedges who played Epstein was to do it all

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
act direct produce he's already started a film production company called

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Topeka which is Latin for marijuana sort

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
of that year John Travolta starred in both

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Saturday Night Fever and grief. He seemed stressed me out I kept looking for indications

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
of lack of commitment to the role of Barbary know now that he's become a movie star such as the phoning

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
in of his catchphrase only doing the Who in the

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
what but not bothering with the

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
where Welcome Back Kotter takes place on four

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
sets more or less. The classroom. The hallway by the lockers the school

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
yard and the cottage living room. The same articles of clothing appear over and over

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
again one shirt in particular T. shirt with a bald eagle ironed on

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
kept showing up on different sweat hogs as though they were real life friends who shared each other's clothes.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
There was no not a jean jacket in season three. I did however find an important

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
bit of Connor pranking philosophy in episode eighteen a new girl

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and she enrolls in their one room schoolhouse. James the Canon

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
why she walks into class in the White House and go nuts. I'm

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
pretty sure you can see Epstein's heart beat out of his chest through his shirt a bug funny

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
like that and he's not interested in dating the sweat hogs she wants to become one of them.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
She drops a pain on. Vice Principal of the wave impressing the guys at the bar bring a cause or an

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.000
amateur

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
or our stunt always have two things he tells

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
are their original and they leave no

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
evidence than a jean jacket prank satisfied both criteria.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
It was so original no one has ever heard of

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:27.000
it and apparently it left not a shred of evidence behind.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
needed to talk to someone who worked directly on the show. Maybe the lunchbox image came from something that

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
happened on the set like an inside joke five out of six the main Welcome Back Kotter

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
cast

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
members were either dead. Trimming down when I asked or John Travolta dealing

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
with the release of going clear on H.B.O. The six of gave Kaplan who played

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Carter himself as a welcome back comma.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I was given his cell phone number but didn't hear back. So I tried the man who co-created the show

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
with Alan sax Dear Mr Sax I wrote there's

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
an image on the collar lunchbox that we just can't

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.000
understand.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Alan got back to me right away and gave me the address so I could come talk to him about it in

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
person and he

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
didn't he just one question though.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Who is we show before we get started on well maybe we are sort of I wanted to tell

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
you something when you said we you

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
know in the

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
email that I responded to you who is we it's

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
drug something that was really one of the really

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
interesting events in my

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
life I was hoping gunpoint by Phil

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Spector for like five

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:57.000
hours

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
when was this it was nine hundred eighty. I was producing. This

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
pilot for

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
A.B.C. And who better for me to get to do

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
the music than Phil Spector and I got him on the phone and he

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
says great. Come on over.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
So we set up a time he and I and his secretary calls me to

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
confirm and she said who's coming and I said I'm coming

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
myself I said OK I'll let Phil know that come at seven thirty. But as

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I'm leaving the office the casting director is there said What are you

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
doing let's go get some Japanese food and I said OK let's do that but I gotta go over to Phil Spector's house

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
tonight want to take a ride with me. We'll go up there will listen to some music and then we'll

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
go out to eat after

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
what we get in my car. We start driving down the Sunset

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Strip it was smoking a joint we're listening to diet straights on the radio on

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
way to Phil Spector's house very excited.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Now we get to the end of Sunset and he lives up a cul de

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
sac in Beverly Hills as we're getting closer as

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
bob wire signs that say no trespassing protected by Smith

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:11.000
and

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Wesson pressed the buzzer the gate opens up drive my car

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and park it we get

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
out two dogs come charging at

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
us

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
the door opens up and there's a guy standing in like a

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
karate student a giant said Hi I'm Joy drum

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
solos man. Hi Joy jam Alan. This is Cathy. Come on

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
in we go when George closes the door and he locks

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
it with the kid from the inside click click click and

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
puts became his pocket.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
So I look at Kathy and the only way I know we can get added

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
air is that George has to open up the door.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
He brings us into you know this beautifully appointed living room to

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
finish leather bound books leather chairs and pictures a

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Lenin pictures of the Ramones pictures and I contain the Righteous

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Brothers and suddenly

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
at the very far end of the room huge huge room.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
We hear wrestling then Phil Spector comes down the steps and he

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
looks over Kathy and

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
he screams at the top of his lungs.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
There's too many people

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
here too many people in my

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
house he wasn't expecting Kathy.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
This is

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
just

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
too many people here I go with no wait it just works

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
and goes running

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
out

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
he comes out about a half hour later sits down at the coffee table shakes my

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
hand and he looks at me and says What are you doing here. Will you know what I'm doing here I called you we spoke on

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
the phone. I want you to do the music for this pilot that I'm doing. He said no no

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
no you're here because you want to go back and tell people I drink too much.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
I take drugs and I play with guns. If daddy stands up.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
He takes off his jacket and he straps with the biggest gun I've ever been in a woman in my

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
life and now the gun comes

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
out and I said but that shit away Man I gotta get outta here he said no no you know we're not

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
ready to go yet. And for the next six hours like

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
waving the gun around insanity.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
He asked me if I knew karate and I said no he's a come on I'll show you

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
karate and then he said Do you like Leonard

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Cohen I said I love when it's on he said Good I want to play you some tracks. And

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
so now we have to go and lay down his music room on the floor. He's on the floor

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
of Kathy's on the floor. God is between us and we have the headset

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
and we're listening to Leonard Cohen singing you like

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
learning death of a ladies man that album Listening

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
to the tracks of Devon

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
a ladies' man expected with a gun

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
between

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
he said I wrote the music for you you wrote the music for me kidding.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Wow So we go to the piano room and he starts playing on the piano a

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
dirge and I can't sing but it goes like where all rock N rollers rock N roll is

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
all trying to earn a living before the final curtain

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
call and the gun is like on the piano and he would pick it up every

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
one song come on Allen sing it with me where all rock N rollers

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
rock N roll it's all trying to earn a living before the final

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
curtain got hot. This went on

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
ours. So

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
finally some

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
guy worked at a radio station. He was working

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
with the late lobster shift he was getting off and called Phil and said hey I want to come by I'm going to

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
come by with yeah come on

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
by so when this guy came we were able to scurry out of

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
the room like a kitten and then with a

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
guy the next day

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
he sent me all sorts of gifts like Phil Spector cocktail napkins

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
and then those Dad said Hey Al I really had a swell time with you

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
last night.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Let's do it again soon.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
But the president of A.B.C. said to me. Well did you get Phil Spector to do the music does he

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
want to do it I said you know

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
what he does but. Tell us of the Mahdi you got to have the next meeting with him because I'm

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
not so when you

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
said I don't want to surprise I

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
was doing my full spectrum.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
So now we could talk about Potter.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
I tried to get right to the point less so let another careless turn on flipout

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
I asked Alan if it wasn't too much trouble. Will you please tell me every single thing he knew about the welcome

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
back Ireland box of that I don't remember.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Of course he didn't I didn't really care about the merchandise and

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Carter didn't care was one way of putting it another was I got screwed

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:37.000
on that

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
show Allen had sold the pilot for Cotter within six months of moving to Hollywood.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
He had no idea what he was doing he didn't get syndication rights. He didn't get merchandising rights.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
He did get a lot of hotel pool lounging time in though. But until that counts of legal

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
tender as I've often petition for two there wasn't much he could do with that

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
now I showed Alan the image on the lunch box.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
What he think is happening in

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
that his Epstein's

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
jacket. He's accusing somebody

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
of doing something to his jacket.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
You see the knots in the

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
sleeves. Oh yeah. What is out of the bag.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
I don't know why that happened.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
He's saying the same to Travolta you tied this up you tied not to

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
measure it why would they tie a knot in the sure is that a thing was a thing in your childhood.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
It was. You know he by the way you're like wearing what's on the lunchbox you're

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
wearing a denim shirt. Button down shirt and

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
jeans This is from Japan and this is this is a Japanese denim shirt named

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
I haven't even worn this shirt in

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
like four years was in the back of my closet.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:59.000
He didn't just one fast he just happened to make me interested a lunch box.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
That's funny. Spring I want to wear a transitional shirt that will get

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
me from the winter to the spring in like a very subtle way and I wanted

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
it to be so of.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
I left. Allen's no closer to understanding the purpose of putting knots in a jean jacket

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:23.000
sleeve but much more open minded about the versatility of denim in general as an option all year round.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Allen was still in touch with Gabe Kaplan and he connected the two of us by email. I updated my client.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
I talked to

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Alan Sachs who is co-creator Welcome Back Kotter guy.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
It would about Gabe Kaplan unavailable doing what you spoke to get

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Kaplan No you

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
didn't

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
think. From Gabe Kaplan Oh to

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Starlee e-mail right here. Oh OK. Sent it went

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
to AM.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Hi Starlee. I think you're making way too much out of this the images are so leaps in the mind of

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
the illustrator. He probably saw a couple of shows and came up with his ideas. If you ask me to guess what action

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
the picture is trying to detail. My guess is that if Cotter and sweat hog look on Epstein is challenging

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
by brain and some way.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
I like the refers to McCotter. There's nothing behind the grassy

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
knoll

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
cape which means definitely there's definitely something on the

grassy knoll.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Nice try. Gabe Kaplan but your clever attempt to call me out the case backfired.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.000
I now had a new direction to head in toward the mind of the lunchboxes illustrator.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
It was none too soon either as a lunch box mystery seemed to be tightening its grip

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
on John's and already caught a clogged

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
mind when I'm on the

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
subway going to work. I look at people sitting across from me and I think which

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
of them

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
has jackets who sleeves would lend themselves to being nodded at the

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
easiest like I've seen someone in a fur coat and I'd think Oh that would be a really hard one to

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
two jackets we've not had an interesting challenge. Interesting challenge. You know

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
this week's installment of the ingredients

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
list blueberries like the ones found in kind of blueberry vanilla and

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
cashew bars. We all know how hard it can be to get rid of clothing we like but haven't worn in a

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
while right

Kaitlin I love doing this going through all my things and figuring out what I want to cut and what I want to

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
keep I mean the biggest trap that people fall into is one day I'll wear it to a party

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
if there's a time a night when suddenly everything.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Then there's the clothes you wear all the time but

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
I do have a dress just ruined definitely be out with the old

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
the next color will actually work dress. This would be the perfect thing to

Welcome back. Welcome back. Welcome back.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
I've moved on to my next person of interest the creator of the lunchbox.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
I use to find this

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:08.000
outsider and gotten Johnson's role model all wrong.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
I quickly found a name

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
online.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Leonard and

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Elmer Elmer worked for thirty years

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
at Aladdin industries lunchboxes

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
if you were a

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
child relied on

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
food illustrated by

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Elmer

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
getting Elmer about the Welcome Back Kotter lunch box though it would be difficult if not

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
impossible wasn't

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
alive back about calling him a

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
diligent

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
solve the mystery based on eyewitness

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
accounts which he was.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
You said it.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Beverly was his Peggy.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
When I first started working with him I was twenty three he left in lunch

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
boxes his sketches and concepts were just unbelievable.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
He was he was just

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:22.000
good scientist and you lived across the street from Leonard.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
This

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
is Joe the neighbor

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
kid my family built a house right across the street from his house

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
when I was four years old

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
and these were big southern neighborhoods really big lots of

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
his house was up on a big hill in clear sight from my home

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
and had a paved driveway and above the

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
garage was his studio

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
and I remember going into the studio as a

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
kid walking over there on my own I don't even remember if invited

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
me or if I invited myself. He would let me

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
watching

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
at the time I was married to all woman

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
that it didn't it didn't work out in the long run

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
and

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
I was freelancing and she wanted me to have a regular

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
job and this is Dan the late my

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
friend and I went down to interview for a lad and they were looking for an

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000
illustrator and actually I met over the first day.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Elmo

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
was a very unique very talented

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
individual he was not unpleasant but he

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
wasn't like a great carious at

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
all he was very

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
demanding very very quiet. He was a crust. Very

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
very reserved.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Some people had a hard time with him but when I got along great

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
really inside. A teddy bear.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
I'm like Mr Leonhardt and a very talkative very

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
verbal kind of person held his but that all recall him at all acting in

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
the OID questions and he certainly you know talked to me a lot.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
He asked me one of the first things he asked me was did you carry a lunch box when you were a

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
kid amounts of Kerry did Davy Crockett.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
And he said did the art work. That's one of the reasons I took the job.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
I like the idea of working with Elmer you know here's the guy

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000
that illustrated the lunch boxes that I admired as a child.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
I may feel like I was in the presence of

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
something I actually

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
owned Dr Doolittle lunchbox. So

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
I brought in my lunch box and said You mom says you did this painting

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
and he says I did and he pulled out the illustration boards with those

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
paintings on them and the illustration had little tick marks and

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
instructions and didn't look just like your

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
lunchbox it did but you know I don't know if he's ever like seen

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
a poster of a Monday painting. And then seen it in person

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
the vibrance of the real thing is incredible but I love my lunchbox. But here was

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
this original painting that

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
was that was the same

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
size but much more vicious and.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
He

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
spent so much time it took so much pride and what he was

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
doing if very much loved his work. I mean that

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
really set me on a path ultimately can attribute the fact that

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
I wanted to become a commercial artist because of him.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
He said Don't run away from something you're

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
not good at Gallaudet larning like when Alice build a mass.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
A SIT hour and a bill me or a tiny wall so and around me in a book How

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
to like block and brick and found in a study to have a library one that

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
my dad would call me that minute where you get into

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
the all important footing from our tiny while he went you doing

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
what you know my

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
father going through or to he

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
was you know the man as the head of the household. You know and I never resented my father for

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
that it's just that the way he was brought up. But when Elmer come along in

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
my life. He convinced me there was anything I could say.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
One time Beverly told Elmer that she was terrible at drawing hands.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
He told her that she should practice drawing them fifteen minutes every

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
morning over and over again you could always tell no my lunch

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
box for the characters hands while other artists only should fit their hands that

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
were one meshed together

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
unit on Elmer's each finger was individual defined.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
It's true on the card or lunch box. You can see every last one hundred digit.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Mr Cotter's hand drawn and hit his finger splayed if he shewed to students.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
What do you guys up to now look at the teams left hand

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
grips and not a jacket sleeve. Well his right hand pointed index finger at

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
it the pointing finger in fact seems to have been one of the go to

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
move on The Beverly Hillbillies lunchbox Jethro point out the family fancy new

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
digs as they pull up in the jalopy piled high with everything they

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
own and add in twelve bucks a terrifying little girl clutching a teddy

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
bear point gleefully at her brother who's gotten head stuck in a gate and it goes without

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000
saying that Elmer was a perfect artist to capture in ten the most famous

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
pointing finger of the one nine hundred eighty S.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000
E.T.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
since the lunch boxes were commissioned before the actual film or T.V. show came out the Aladdin illustrators were

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
sent footage. They then chose images

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
from Sometimes they were invited to see Katrina. It was Elmer came

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
up with Aladdin signature style to have the images on the lunchbox tell a story so that

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
the kids who belong

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
to would want to look all over it like miniature portable versions of

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
the films and shows they loved and Aladdin

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000
based in Nashville was like a miniature version of the Hollywood studio system.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
There were the trips to L.A. to meet with big wigs.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
I went in this huge office it was all glass back in the back that Beverly

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
again and in was this this guy he was all

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.000
real disheveled

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
and he looked like somebody had been clean in a piano want to mate and

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
he turned around and it was filmed

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
or Spielberg himself had to approve the lunchbox Yes he wanted

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
to

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
do with a fragile egos a movie stars to

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000
consider Rex Harrison was in every surface of the fricken lunch box to see

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
was Dr Doolittle So you know five different instances of Rex

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Harrison standing there with a push me pull you

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
into the Big Giant. Snail.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
And we spent some time looking at it and he showed me a few things and then he says

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
and you see the color of his eyes the same and it's this tiny

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
little dot of paint. He said I had to redo that several times

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
because Rex Harrison told me that his eyes were not that

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000
color

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
as well as the physical impossible to please taste of network

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
executives every year I had to come up with a new concept for Mickey and

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Minnie punch boxes and so I had making many in

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Paris making many in the US the algae

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.000
soda

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
fountain making in many caveman. And pirate making in

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000
many

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
I mean it was a long process stealing one the oldest ration because

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
there's approval from Disney every stage she would say

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
in concept after concept and they would you know.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Now let's see some more think on one in about thirty

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
different concepts till I got so frustrated

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
that I did make a hole in the leash looking down at Pluto squashed on

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
the road with tire tracks down his

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
back you

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
killed a random over the

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
little crosses on

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
is

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
an ascended to Disney and our director at the time she called me

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000
she said you know we're not going to approve. But the

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:06.000
artist year passed it around the net a good laugh.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.000
There

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
was ever present risk of producing a

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
flop as a way far south

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
California boy. David a

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
show and then all of a sudden it became one of our top

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
sellers or passing on a hit that would then go to a competing

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
studio rival lunchbox

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
manufacturer thermos when Star Wars came

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000
out for marketing. So we got to go with our

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
faces never done well. Star Trek didn't do that well Lost in Space didn't do that

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000
well black hole black hole was a bomb and we kept it all but this is different it's different.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
We ended up not taking it passed we passed on our garments

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
to and left one of the most

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
popular of

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
all.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:03.000
And in

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
between there was lounging by hotel

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:12.000
pool

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000
a few years ago that we also

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
visited the Smithsonian

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
cafeteria and I was looking at all the T.V. stuff you know straight out and then

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
I turned around and then here's just just this wall of lunch boxes. Now and there's

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
my Sesame Street up there is grandma. There's gaining.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:35.000
My brother a listen Knoxville behave. He was a banker.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
He always silent not an artist just a hobby. You know because my father.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Haywood said I We can't afford for both of you get a college you know your brother ago

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
because you know he would be

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
the breadwinner the family and he needs to go and see my brother he finally said to

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000
me best you know let me just go and get you a a real

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000
job and I said I have a real job. I got to illustrate

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000
lunchboxes from a thirty five years. I got to do some now really love to doing and the

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
SAT them in the Smithsonian and you're not and he just kind of

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
stopped you like doing it I loved it. That's the

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
only job working for somebody else that I look forward to going to work every

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
day especially when I was working on an illustration.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
It was merchandising and licensing and all that stuff but it same time it

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
was you know smiling faces on I have a

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000
million

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Elmer and I did the last four

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
together that last year

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
was when he seemed to really need a

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
friend he was kind of you

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
know been pushed in the past

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
year there was no work for him.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
No you call me as if that was a new thing. It could do

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
your think it was two

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
weeks before he

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.000
died

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
it was in July of ninety eight and I had

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:17.000
gone

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.000
too far with black girls and.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000
By before last now in our caucus and you've always done a portrait of other

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
people when when I get back and I want you to do a portrait from

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
A and he goes OK The day before I came home he

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
thought he had been out. Moe and his lawn that

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
day and he came and sat down in the chair to

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
read up on the porch on the patio

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
and that that's where he

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
died he left me over four hundred of his books.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
He said he wanted me to have them because he thought I would

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:11.000
and

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Elmer was a private person when he died he was an enemy to a published at

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:28.000
his request.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:28.000
When

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:28.000
you

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
go to high school. What decade the seventy's the seventies. I'm fifty two

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000
now was jacket nodding a big prank in your day.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
No doubt. Elmer painted the

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Welcome Back Kotter lunch box then he really did that one too.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
So I guess the neighbor kid wasn't going to help me solve my mystery.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Danna no memory of it either the Beverly she was working with Elmer the year he got the car account.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
I was sure that if anyone would know why he chose to put the not a chirp. On the lunch box. It would be

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
her but when I asked her about it she said she'd have vague memory of him working on

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
it but couldn't recall any actual specific details beyond that there's an

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
image on it the lunch box that has one of the characters

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000
holding up the denim jean jacket with knotted sleeves. I can't figure out

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
what the jean jacket

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000
means it might be a joke but what's the joke. The joke is

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
if you try to put on your Jane jacket and the the not during the Flavin again get

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
are getting at the joke.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.000
I think it's a joke but there were times when.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
You didn't question Elmer.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
I don't think I've got that cutter

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
lunchbox do you have a lot of lunch

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
boxes when I first went there I started saving one of each one that

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
I

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
illustrated of probably get.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Oh maybe fifty or sixty hanging from the rafters

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
in the kitchen hanging.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Yeah living in a log house it's one hundred fifty years

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000
ago the restaurant across the room just

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000
as nails with rows of lunch

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
boxes looking at I'm right here most of

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000
them

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
do you see a bunch of Elmers right now.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Yes Several say there's

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Mouseketeers though if you ever saw the by

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:40.000
cent annual lunch about the little cartoon characters of.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Signers of the Declaration of Independence those

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
characters he based himself and his wife.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Elmer painting himself into the bicentennial image was a first tangible piece of evidence

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
I had that he'd made something up on a lunch box. Unless he really. It was one of

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
the signers of the Declaration of Independence.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
I'm rich and happy or I'm getting it right now. That's

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
film and that's his wife is Betsy Ross she says and

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
there's phone stars on the flag

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
and he's holding up a shirt with star shaped holes in

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
it with a gruff look on his face and that's his sense

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
of

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000
humor with the cut stars. That's the kind of

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
humor that he put in its illustration

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
of cowboy now another Sure based gag just like Welcome Back

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Kotter and thought about maybe that's his real house.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Elmer son is on the Dr Doolittle lunch box as an islander holding a rope attached to the

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
giant snail. By really poses the Beinecke woman standing in Elmer's

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000
office pantomiming ripping a phonebook in half. It's her body in the final image

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
of Wendy Wagner's

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
face on the land of a giant lunchbox Almer apparently just went for

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
it the stars of the show are so tiny you can't even make out who the actors

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
are they've been captured by a giant and in his face the takes up most of the

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
image that's Elmer's face.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
It's huge the only thing that take that more

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
space are all ten fingers of his giant

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
hand

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000
and Aladdin toes traders were allowed to sign their

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
boxes everything you did Aladdin blong to Aladdin.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Perhaps the Cotter scene was another way for Elmer to insert himself into the

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
illustrations by creating an image that was both the original and left no

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
evidence but even if that were the case

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000
already got the idea for the knives we prank in the first place to come from his own life.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
He was one of the first T.V. wrestlers

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.000
really to go rest alone at night and then he would draw during the day. He had a big

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
nose from all the getting beat up all the top.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Starlee he used to bring fail me and. No mater fake you know. And

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
it's out weave he put it on up there against the wall you know in the back in this with him in

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Chicago wrestling and Beck began. You know there was always the began the bad guy and he was the

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
back and hey was hell Arius because he would cast stand there

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000
with this kind of shuffle you know like abandonware Easter get right to attack and that's

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000
why you were the one who sneaked up behind the referee a page

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
don't get my faces and he goes well as well get by to go there early about the one who's out

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
both cause the trouble.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
We grew really close. We had a lot of one time we went to North

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Carolina

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
together. We had a printer over there and we went over there for a

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000
proofing while we were there I wanted to go to the

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:54.000
museum and he didn't want to go to the museum he wanted to go to the mud wrestling.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000
He was not a big fan of modern art and that's to put it

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
mildly. He was he was a devoted craftsman when you lay

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
a law and illustration board with the number two

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
side will brush

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000
with the consonants to be able to make it a good clean

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000
sharp line that the ends where you want to think and where you want

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
it to takes a real masterful stroke to do

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
that and then you have

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000
somebody kind of bucket on the strange and. Spoken a hole in the bottom

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
of it and swing it back and forth over Kansas.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
It was all just garbage to you know it was a

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:44.000
scam that somebody had sold. You know to the public.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Unlike professional

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000
wrestling actually And

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000
so we decided to go to the museum

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000
early and go to the mud wrestling afterwards.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000
You know what they say. One man's mud wrestling is another man's cafeteria

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:09.000
lunch vice a professional wrestler. Yeah.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Do you think of

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Elmer when you say professional wrestler.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Yes I do not. Well that's what he was before he really. Yes

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000
before your

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000
painting lunchbox.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
I

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.000
never knew that you are full of wonderful

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000
information prank. It doesn't seem to that happen on the show

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.000
and it didn't seem to represent the

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.000
show it never happened on the show so it could have come completely out

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000
of the creative imagination

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000
of Linhardt Yes I mean now that I know he was a he

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000
was one of these professional wrestlers he probably did that very

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
prank using as a wrestling move. I mean just the fact that he

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
went into

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000
that world which is full of pranks. You got to come up with

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000
creative ways of combatting your your opponent wrestling.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Yeah I like that. OK now look into

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.000
that

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000
you did good neighbor kid you did good.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000
OK so I just need to find a wrestler who is equally conversant in

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000
both pranks and

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000
clothing

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
that wrestler was called

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Cabana Oddly enough I make my own notes that's really the

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.000
great craft to have a wrestler like we deal with like Ryan materials and outfits a lot even though

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
I'm you know six foot one two hundred forty pounds. I still have my little sewing machine

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.000
and I and I So that's adorable. Thank you know that's adorable.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000
While the rest of us have been going on with our everyday lives buying clothing in

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
stores crack. In

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000
cases restoring wonder to an otherwise drab universe.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000
There's been a whole world of competitive professional wrestling happening out

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000
there perhaps a villa chasm left behind by the demise of competitive

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:18.000
lunchbox manufacturing.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Can

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.000
you have yours in a wrestling move that involves knotting a jacket.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000
I can't say that I have there's wrestling moves where you can actually

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000
put a person in a physical

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.000
not with some when I

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:35.000
show

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000
called What's happened is it's been tied in knots at the flea.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000
So you can't put your you can't put your hands into the

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.000
sleeves that part I didn't need a professional to tell me the whole thing's a

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:54.000
jean jacket that Epstein's holding actually blonde Sobrino a belief I find confusing

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
and wrong but I allowed to

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.000
proceed in this situation. Sure Volta was in class and

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.000
he was in a hurry and he had to leave and then he left his

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.000
sweet denim jacket behind right. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.000
tie both of his sleeves in a knot because there's got to be consequences for him

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:14.000
leaving this

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:20.000
around wrestlers pull pranks on each other so often they had their own words for them Brits.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000
If I leave my phone in a wrestling locker room and I come back twenty minutes and

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000
it hasn't been tampered or screw with. I am singing to the guys in the

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:30.000
resting well I like that

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.000
like putting anything. Qualifies as you asking for it.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Let us never forget the caution a tale of a prank that was pulled on a wrestler a friend of

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Colts by Colt on the night the friend won a big championship.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:48.000
So he just won the title and he was happy like it was a dream come

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000
true and everything that he had ever wanted in his life. You know I would have thought he would have

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:57.000
been sleeping with his title belt and would have never let go of it but for some reason he he left

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000
his his championship on the desk. In the

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000
back and so of course I took the belt and

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000
I. I snuck into the wrestling ring itself climbed up the scaffold and

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000
I cascaded my way up way to the very top of the

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:17.000
building and looked at titled album and when you say you climbed up the scaffold

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
there was ladders and tables and chairs did you

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.000
just stacked twenty chairs and of each other and then climb up those to the top. You know

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:28.000
it's wrestling Donkey Kong for the greatest

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000
and you know he was so upset he was genuinely upset

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000
genuinely yelling like where's the Mars my title and you know as a room of so you

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000
know fifty people just casually looking up to the sky.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000
We just always kind of look up and then look down and

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.000
eventually I think after threatening to punch somebody basically almost crying.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000
We let him have his belt back and those are the guys that get ripped because

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:58.000
why read somebody who's not going to care like there's no fun in that.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000
And they never learned today

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:05.000
that

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.000
I still hadn't been anyone who'd ever done the knot tying prank or

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000
anyone could ever had done to them or anyone who's ever heard of it being

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000
done but who better than a wrestler to find out for Jonathan whether or not it worked

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000
as a prank.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000
You can borrow that.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000
Rip and you can use it if you when you're on it when you're on tour.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000
I mean I'll take requests. You know I'll take a

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.000
question I'm going to give this a chair. And I'll let you know

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:36.000
how my opponent enjoyed it. Or did not enjoy the rip you're really going to try.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000
I wrestle for ten minutes a night and I have so much time to

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.000
waste with my partner out in the streets. I shifted to desk work.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:51.000
One of my investigators Eric had disappeared down or rabbit hole a pranking related library research.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
I probably should've called someone. But instead it gave me an

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:58.000
idea.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000
Beverly had told me that Aladdin wasn't and. That's source material to work from the illustrators that

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000
use outside material to fill in details of their

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:10.000
drawings one of Elmer hadn't gotten the not hankering from Welcome Back Kotter from

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.000
another show and then it just kind of planted the prank onto the cotton lunchbox.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:17.000
I

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.000
found a ten minute clip of Family Feud with a cotter cast competed against a love boat cast that

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:27.000
was immediately apparent would be of no help boys I nonetheless watched from beginning to end and

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000
then ten to Jonathan while so watched from the getting to end with oddly

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
hypnotic Orszag was the leaders who did

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000
it and Richard Dawson at one point suck his own

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:43.000
tongue

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.000
and then finally I caught a break the a another half hour to come about for

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.000
the shit and just who's the adult and who's a kid here authority figure in their

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000
lives Always Sunny In

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Philadelphia

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:05.000
the show had him come close to existing when the lunchboxes made or for that matter.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Welcome Back Kotter was

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.000
on the side from that one technicality. Everything else tracked.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.000
OK so the episode I want to talk to you about is in season five

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
and it's episode twelve the season

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000
finale sure you know the first episode I ever

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
wrote the first anything I ever

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.000
wrote this is Dave and the episode he wrote the character played by Glenn

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Howerton and Danny De Vito has a rivalry with a local bar. They break into the

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:41.000
bar owners house and start playing pranks. What were those pranks.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000
I remember they did his taxes and they they

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:51.000
they mailed his shoes on the ground of his squad let's move.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000
I believe they may cut his shower curtain out ways to

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
hide a good one

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000
and they tie his shirt in action. I have

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.000
seriously now. Where did you get the idea for Frank to

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
tie the shirt sleeves in

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.000
knots how man.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Honestly I had no idea.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:24.000
So you wrote a scene with a nod as we prank and you don't know where that came

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000
from no now I am from my

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.000
mind to that makes sense to why that's a prank.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:40.000
I'm not going to hear an amazing prank. Yeah I think I got it.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.000
How do you know when your feelings about Welcome Back Kotter you now it's

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000
a distant

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000
memory as a lunch box the Welcome Back Kotter had an on

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000
lunch box. Epstein is holding up

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000
a jean jacket the sleeves of the jacket are tied in

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.000
knots does there's been a mystery about what that jean jacket

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:06.000
means and you're your episode one of the only pieces of evidence of every scene that it's

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000
a prank. Ah. What does it

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000
mean yeah well I cannot be there but I'd swear I'm going to

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:25.000
go back and watch your back.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:25.000
I

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000
would

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:26.000
love

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.000
nothing more than the key to your mystery side sounds like I've made your

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
life even harder than it was already started

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
and I'm beginning to suspect

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000
conspiracy before starting this case I'd

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:45.000
never realized Cotter was so dangerous to the establishment of course the real

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.000
question was

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.000
why ask yourself why was it no one is allowed and remembered a single

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:55.000
detail about the lunchbox getting made Ask yourself why did Jonson

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000
appear to be the only person who's ever wondered about the Nona

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000
jacket. Ask yourself why didn't anyone seem to know there's a comma in

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
the title of the show to quote Donald Sutherland paraphrasing a

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.000
fictional Malcolm of real life people in the film J.F.K. There was an air of a light on

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000
now make believe to the whole thing how else do you

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
explain what happened to one of my investigators

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Alex in the midst of us working on the

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.000
case.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I was on the

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
show says that

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
this truck shop near my house was running

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
and I was meeting somebody talk about

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
something with a few details and that's the least suspicious thing he said.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Anyway I looked up

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
and I saw

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
this just above the espresso machine just sitting

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
there so we

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
are the

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000
exact walking back out of lunch box where he's not objective. Just like randomly perched on top of an ice

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
machine in this was the shop that I built this

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000
morning and you asked him about it yeah I did. Yeah that's what was it. They were

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000
like oh is this show back in the seventies like I don't know I know I heard before about the lunch

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
bugs two days that are working there just been sitting there. They don't know where it came from and they're

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:20.000
like No

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Idea or so they said. Who knows what they found out before their mind

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
or

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000
raced it was really like you know the

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
legs up when I'm the president says I was like this big double album and it was like all the like really domestic scenes

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000
like just like sort of like sort of Norman Rockwell it sort of seems like people and like eating breakfast and sort of like these

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Defoe's And then there was this like weird

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
little black mandala that was just placed in different places all around

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
it and like that's what this felt like oh my god it's like

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000
tracking

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
the weirdest thing.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Try to remember that it was just as I feared that actually true for us you

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000
know they've got to Alex.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
How else to explain the email I got shortly after from Alan Sachs that

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
read quote just received this from a fan of Missouri asking for my

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
autograph had never received a request via mail asking me to find

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
a picture. What kind of voodoo you were

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
seeing the picture he'd been sent to find was naturally of

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
the lunchbox.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000
But you already knew that it had been scanned on a piece of paper the lunch box

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:47.000
just floating without comment without explanation in the middle of the page.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
How else do you explain the following exchange between me and the company that held the original merchandise life

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000
into the lunchbox while for production all productions are no longer but I wrote to

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
the curator at archives asking for any information related to the

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
lunchbox she responded that she'd done a search of the quote

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
cutter

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
merchandising binder. But hadn't come across any mention of the lunchbox at all she'd be happy

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000
to set up an appointment for me to come visit to archive in person though to look through larger set the

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
folders pertaining to publicity marketing and miscellaneous furcata

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
large traffic I

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
said and suggested a date at which point I received another email.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I actually had a chance to go through the other color files. Sadly I was not able to find

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
any documents that addressed a specific question you were seeking to have answered I will keep an

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
eye out for you however I'm really sorry for this

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
news. I will back again saying basically that my idea of

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:45.000
a

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.000
good time was coming through files that more than likely lead to nothing and could I please still fed up an appointment.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Sure Roback the curator except the reading room would be closing in a couple

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
weeks for some

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
months. Well then could I make an appointment before

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
it closed.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Unfortunately came the reply the reading room was all booked up for the remaining days it was open.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Maybe there'd be a cancellation I tried. Could you let me know

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000
if that was the last I heard from her.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I doubt she was ever heard from by anyone ever again

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
actually I did get an email from a colleague though the

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
material that you

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
originally requested is not part of the collection. I'm not sure what you are

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
expecting us to produce for you to look at I had no

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000
idea emails can make the sound of a slamming door.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I had arrived at the point that all investigators

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.000
do when confronted with a mass conspiracy the obsessive revisiting of

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
evidence while your family moves out. I found myself returning to the

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Cotter episodes hunting for that one clue. I must have missed.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
And that's when I saw them

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000
lunchboxes you could just barely make them out. They were perched on a shelf in

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
the sweat house classroom back into the left of John Travolta's

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000
hair Planet Of The Apes and the Disney bus. Both Elmer's.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.000
And the next episode a third box appeared. And then a fourth. I watched more

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000
episodes fast forwarding until I got to the classroom scene. Sometimes the boxes moved to the window.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Sometimes they went back down to two the Disney bus was a constant always

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
there always

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000
watching Never learning still thing just nothing behind the grassy

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
knoll Mr

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Cotter

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Meanwhile

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
somewhere in a sea of spandex some of it hands

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
down.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
This

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:20.000
is

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
called a ban I'm in a locker room right now Marty

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
score a lot you don't know what we're doing right. I have no idea really know if you agree to play on

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
the yes going to give me lots of trouble which you know happens call anyway.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
So here's what we're going to do this is Doug Williams Doug Williams twenty two year veteran

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000
a professional I used to watch him when I was maybe like twelve in the cups and we bring that over

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:42.000
to

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000
us Rob is actually brought back his coach his new coach. It's well watch

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000
that he just this life arrived this lovely great British You need Jacques

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Rogge which is anyone twice.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:02.000
So we're going to tie this in a knot. Yeah. And we're going to have to get his reaction.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Yeah I feel bad already. I know I'll take all the blame. OK You say that now I feel I'm going to

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
backfire on May. Oh God.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Hold on. So you have one and I have the other. Yeah. And

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.000
now we're going to pop all kind of tight.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000
This is hard but I'm kind of are we going to break it now it's not a break it's out of spandex.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
OK the stitching I'm right

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000
about now OK it's a pretty tight.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Maybe knees

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Dimona you want to three knots Yeah.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
There we go

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:51.000
yeah

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
yeah

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:53.000
right

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
she

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000
talk about match afterwards he doesn't know yet he looks like he's really blowing up is always a. And so

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
a so he might

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:08.000
say

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:08.000
a little

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
more so in a

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:18.000
row

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
on breakfast.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I now knew the night his sleeves could be done as a

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000
prank but the mystery was where the print could come from and I still

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
didn't have proof that anyone besides Cole Cabana had ever done it before and

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Colt couldn't have been the inspiration for the lunchbox because that's not how time

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000
works and then there came a

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
day that my investigator Eric

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
resurfaced pale in unshaven clutching a page from a

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:55.000
book called The modern cowboy. I have a question for you about

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
a prank that is done that involved tying shirt sleeves and not.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
On the planet many times.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Uncountable isn't John the

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000
cowboy comma modern So what is what

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:13.000
is the

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000
print they struggle to get their arms to

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
end up

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000
back and is a satisfying payoff. When one

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:24.000
can't get the shirt

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:31.000
on all of it think in the causal factor.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
It's leave our arm or go through the sleeve.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000
So to disruption to the normal the normal flow of events and then that is

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
enough to produce laughter by discovering that there are

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000
minutes

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000
when Cowboys go out on the ground that you know started they lied

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
and has a

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
warm falsely sure that

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
like

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
the. He just lied in the late. I'm a patient

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000
man for the first person I've ever spoken to who's not only her is the knot

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000
tying prank but has done it as far as I know you invented this

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
prank asked.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Well I think that probably learned from an old

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000
rancher most of them were drunk or add impish sense

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
of humor and were all very capable of pulling pranks.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000
So like if you see an article of clothing that just laying there. It's hard for you to not think be to

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
tie the knots.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Yeah. You must seize the opportunity you

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:38.000
can

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000
see in the church choir pretty easily the ladies in

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
our soprano sax and they're never just

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000
acting a prank kind of they react. Well they

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000
always know that

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000
it is it easier to tie

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
acquire ladies' robes knots or a Cowboys like

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000
shirt shirt sleeves the choir.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And more nothing but the ladies in the choir. They're not

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.000
vengeful No although one of them stay for

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
my my music folder to gather not

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000
in your sheet music together. Yeah that's a good

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
prank at the good prank. Do you think this is a distinct cowboy prank

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
the not a

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000
sleeve they're the only only people I ever knew who did

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
it now it could be considered a church choir prank.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Yeah I guess in like a pretty good there isn't to my

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:48.000
repertory

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
So you're satisfied that said Frank. We've proven time out of five that

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.000
that this not it we've prank has a history in this country this is

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
the oldest the cowboys who killed toiled with.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Makes sense a cowboy would think to do that because they're always thinking

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000
about those and they would be the ones to really see a rope in

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:10.000
a sleeve or other

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000
people so tight

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000
two guys play tug of war with that sleeve as tight as they possibly could just

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000
never get it out again because then maybe would be not such an innocent prank because then

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
you both sleeves and in the person's freezes to death because they can't get there like if

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
you're stranded on a

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
mountain climbing Mount Everest and

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
then chose to do it

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
then why would you do that

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.000
and then they would have to cut it off and

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
then

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:57.000
that's a terrible break.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:57.000
No

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
it's very sad very

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
satisfying lunch pails are filled

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000
with sandwiches a thrown garbage because your mother makes bad sandwiches or tell you

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
a generic mother here. My mother my mother was a saint.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I get that. Thank you.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Wow

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:25.000
do

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.000
I get to keep on I was. Are you

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.000
kidding i would have wrapped up it's kind of like Artie. In a box. This is fantastic.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:59.000
It's going to be on my home into the Smithsonian.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
In our logo on a T. shirt. You can get the

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
mystery

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
membership of the T. shirt has the

measure

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000
him sleeves of the T. shirts are probably too short for NOT purposes

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:31.000
but if you're feeling confident and if you haven't listen to the game.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
This is the hard part.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.000
This is the last episode of season one a mystery show. Did you think I was going to last

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000
episode period.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.000
No way I'll be back soon. As quickly as

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000
mysteries a gimlet Media dot com I know you all waited a while for this one and that I threw out

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
some dates that turned out to be red

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
herrings. And I want you to know what that meant to me

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I read every tweet every email every message and I'll miss you guys one guy.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
There isn't a new clue this time

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000
but I do want to give you an explanation for the old one the opening credits to Welcome Back

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Kotter featured a sign. Welcome to Brooklyn fourth largest city in

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:24.000

or no it isn't. Yes it is I don't believe you. Yeah it's like ten big pieces but you lay on the

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
ground and then you can lie beside Gabe Carter when do you get

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
it as a child. No as an adult you got it.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Listen I was sharing something that I thought might be pertinent to our

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:43.000
case.
