00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Hi

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm pretty loose and welcome to sampler the show where we play you can

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
pick moments from podcast. That you just have to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
hear. On today's show we are talking about the is capable pop cultural

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
phenomenon that is beyond phase six studio album

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
lemonade as an hour long music video on H.B.O. on April twenty

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
third. It's fiance's most ambitious personal political artistic

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
work and the conversation around it has been nonstop since it dropped for better

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
or for worse whether you like it or not lemonade is

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
everywhere and this gives us the perfect

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
opportunity to look at the world of pod casting in the aftermath of a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
singular major event. So today we're taking a long hard look

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
at how a bunch of different cast gulped down there. And even if

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
you haven't seen it. Don't worry there is still plenty of refreshing discussion to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
go around.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But before we get started allow me to note that while lemonade is delightfully sweet

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
some of the themes and language in this episode are. More on the tart side. So if

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
you're babysitting Blue Ivy or hanging around any other youngsters. Now take a time to

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
pause and slip in some ear

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:23.000
buds

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
sipping on

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
lemonade with me today is Quiana Fitzgerald of N.P.R. Music.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Can I thank you so much for coming on thimble or thank you for having me bring me home I got my absolute pleasure.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So full disclosure Kam is a friend of mine and also a really talented music

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
journalist for N.P.R. Music and Candy you actually did a review for N.P.R.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
like immediately after lemonade came out I did tell me about

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
it so the process was really stressful because I had no time

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to listen and ingest in like figure out what does this mean. So it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
was really

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
like OK I'm going to seclude myself for like the next however

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
many hours I had until I had to like tape in track and everything and I mean I'm

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
not going to lie. It was a really emotional thing for me like because the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
themes within them an age especially visually are about like the black female

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
experience so going

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
through that album. Again and again and again was

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
a lot. Let's let's actually hear a little bit of that

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
review.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Beyond say. Couldn't have produced an album justify it or blood. Two years

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
ago Limon aid has been made possible by the cultural social and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
political upheaval we're in the midst of triggered by the deaths of boys

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and fathers who will never be forgotten but the pain of the women who love them.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
We've all been changed by

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
these events beyond say maybe a machine but she's changed too.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And so has to read

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
William's actress Amanda Stenberg. Literary giant in the making or some Shire

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and the other figures featured front and center in the visual version of the album

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
from the women who look like my mom my aunties and my cousins to the women carrying the grief of

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
a nation the mothers of Trayvon Martin Garner Mike Brown.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
really got to say exactly what I wanted to say as a black woman and I'm very

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
grateful that N.P.R. didn't you know strip out my voice and make me be more

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
objective about it than I could have been because this is about me in a way

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
to so Bianchi's I made was organized into chapters that show

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
different stages of this musical journey different stages of like I guess

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
how you maybe reconcile after infidelity a relationship ranging from intuition

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to anger toward them she was kind of

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
like the cool Ross model of the five stages of grief right.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
So for sampling of lemonade. We're organizing the show

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
into chapters as well beautiful. We're going to explore the different

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
stages of consuming lemonade.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
This should be fun earlier to start

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
it stew. So our first stage is experiencing pure joy.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Our first clip is from the read. Oh of course yes of course of

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
course the reason to talk out hosted by Kid fury and Crystal anyone who has heard their show

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
knows how much

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
they love love love I don't know if there ever was strong enough or know if

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
they just love beyond say so naturally when my money came out they

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
expressed a whole lot of a

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
city enthusiasm. Yeah. I think that's fair.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
This bitch is only getting better and the fact that she talked ourselves after

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
self-titled which I had

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
frankly I was not going to happen next. I was worried

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
about lemonade I was like. What if the slots because how can she outdo self-titled like what what

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I'm going to hear why I'm going to dance. Did you know me better start like this like

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
a goddamn movie and next time. Bitch I'll be paying twenty five dollars to watch it in the theater

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
like and you write me out. Will it be. As I put my next album out in fucking

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
theaters I'll buy the go experience it's because she has shown me

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that she is

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
more than willing to do the work as an artist to only get better and improve like I only

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
expect for Martians to be doing the mill Iraq and I just can't I can't deal with how

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
brilliant this woman is and I

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
cannot I love that she has these concepts and ideas and then hires the right

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
people and connects with the right teams to get her business and

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
visual

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
My Nigga you are top notch do you feel like you have reached a good sign as a

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
photo girl Parkwood

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
could direct a movie with B.S.A. not even any it would just be beautiful

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
like the shots are just so go and raise the dead gorgeous.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I can't think of a saying can

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
I say I cannot take you to my I can't handle it.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
It's all happening again. I've watched lemonade. You know like maybe seven

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
times in the past few days I listen to the album nonstop The only thing that I have

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
may have listened to either the Met is some gospel based because I

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
had to get on the same page as

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Christ thinking to be like Lord thank you Jesus. Thank you.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Where were you when you first heard watched lemonade.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I was with my best friend Greg at his house and we were

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
watching it on H.B.O. go but we didn't know if it was going to pop up like immediately there just

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
like Refresh Refresh and I oh my God please please please. So finally it popped up and like of course

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
we screamed and then we pressed play and didn't say a word

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I was conscious like looking out of the corner my like looking at him like is this is this happening

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
with going to. What is this

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
so Crystal mentioned in the clip that the now. Logical

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
step for beyond say because I you know there's the first thing she did twenty thirteen. She

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
like release an album just on Thursday night after scandal was

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
over and had all the songs all over the US once and then it's kind of a hard talk that and obviously you

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
know like she's like oh OK I'm going to put a musical This is our long music video

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.000
the entire

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
album was on H.B.O. crystals so the next logical step is obviously she has to like really

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
sit in the theaters and with the release of lemonade. You know beyond say has

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
redefined the concept of like the album

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
release again. Yeah I think she's fucking brilliant and I'm very honestly

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
like I'm trying to be objective but there's only so

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
much. You can like skirt around somebody

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
who's pure like passion and commitment to being great

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and she is in a position where she can make these calls to like

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
say you know what I do want to like have a secret album and I do want to

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
like present this on H.B.O. as a cinematic experience so everybody can

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
be watching this together at the same time so we can like live tweeting together and lose our minds together.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Any time that somebody is able to just bring people together in that

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
way I'm all about it so thank you

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
be outside so that brings us to like the next phase.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
OK lemonade permeating unexpected places you know

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
like you know I kind of had this like weird world stopping effect or even if you don't like lemonade. You couldn't help

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
but be like affected by the fact that it came out. Absolutely you know so you kind of have to be living under

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
a rock to not notice. So like you know we've heard a new and sampler.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
That you know definitely pop culture pod casts would have something to say about

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
lemonade for

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
sure it's a cultural event right. But it was such a huge moment that talk of lemonade showed up in

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
some places that like we just did not see coming and one of the first place is actually that it showed

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
up is a podcast we're featuring in our next clip. It's this late show Trump

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
cast hosted by Jacob Weisberg charm cast is a show that's all about trying to understand

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
who Donald. That

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
is OK and widespread mania is taking over our country so Moses'

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
show is Jake of interviewing experts about Donald Trump. But it's not

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
all serious like sometimes they'll have a trump impersonator read his latest tweets.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
You know I said Donald Trump and I see it just clarifying. Thank you thank you.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And yet this clip is also about lemonade.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
So it's a sketch written performed by Steve Wildstein the Chicago improv

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
group Second City. So the premise is that it's an e-mail exchange between

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Republican presidential hopefuls Well former hopefuls Ted Cruz and John K.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
sick this podcast came out before they dropped out of the race and in this clip Cruz in case a

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
car trying to strategize against Donald Trump.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
But keep getting a little

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
distracted Sunday April twenty fourth two thousand and sixteen.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Eight zero six am governor John K. six to Senator Ted

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Cruz

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Ted I'm relieved our people were able to work out an arrangement on this. I

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
gather announcements will be made soon and we can both continue our campaigns with a

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
mutual acknowledgement that a Trump nomination is bad for both party and

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
country. I am sorry I haven't been able to reach out personally yet but I've been very

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
busy since beyond say dropped this full album on us last night.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Karen and I basically spent the evening with our jobs. On the floor how does she do it.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Senator Ted Cruz to Governor case

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
sick eight forty nine A.M. John. I too am glad clear terms could

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
be agreed on although our campaigns differ a great deal in ideas. I know

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
we share a common concern for our party and a sense that Donald's candidacy is destructive

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
to the process and bad for the American people.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Re Clean day. Unbelievable.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Heidi and I were up all night with this thing the visuals are stunning.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Where does she find the time she's a force of

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
nature governor. Basic nine thirty six A.M.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Ted Weaver is telling me we need to be sure about ground rules for Indiana.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
It's important to me also that our statements are worded similarly and that both campaigns

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
stay on message when the inevitable Trump attacks come as for Queen B..

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I'm just in awe of her ability to continually create compelling work and explore

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
new facets of herself as an artist.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I'm really responding to the personal nature of the lyrics on these tracks so brave of

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
her to explore the hardships of her marriage in a public light while still having

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
strong united family images at the end of the piece.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Senator Cruz ten nineteen A.M. John ground rules will be

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
important and Jeff Roe in my office will be very precise about turning over files to

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
you on our existing ground strategies in the States. I know my people are

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
drafting something now in a variety of directions on Donald's response.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Again my whole team was totally sidelined this weekend with beyond says' lemonade.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I think we all needed time to take the whole thing in and digest when it comes

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
to her exploration of marriage. I think it's particularly profound in a country where

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
the institution of marriage is under attack.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
K. sick eleven zero one am Ted I'm glad you brought up

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
conservative values. It's important to me to get the message to voters that a vote for Donald is

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
a vote against the interest of anyone who is a true conservative.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I wish they understood how and the Donald's feigned concern for them is I want to

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
say to these voters.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
He don't love you like I love you. L.O.L.. But I could never do it with the grace

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and flawlessness of clean bank.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Crews eleven fifty six AM agreed very glad we were able to find

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
common ground on this. I swear if Trump wins the nomination. I will take a

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
baseball bat to every car on my block based

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
style case sick. Twelve o four P.M. L.O.L.. I'll

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
join you pay for a

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
life Cruise eleven twelve P.M. seriously.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
So so good can't stop watching it. See you in

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Cleveland very interesting.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
This is like the very last place that I expected to find literally a Donald Trump podcast

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Yeah the last place I fight to the find a lemonade clip. What does this say to you

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
about like the reach because one of things that you said about the album which I agree with is like it's a

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
really black female thing. But it's also this thing that

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
was like super widely relief. Yeah

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
like everybody's like you know as much as it is very

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
specifically directed toward black women this is everybody's album because she is beyond

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
say you know she has performed at the Super Bowl more than

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
once she wants the past five exactly like you know she's a part

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
of our country like she she might as well be on the fucking flag like she's a

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
part of a so

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
I can understand why you know I can listen to a Donald Trump podcast

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and still hear about her because she is like woven throughout the fabric of what we

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
do in

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
America. One of the things about the on say for better or worse thing apart like the national

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
fabric is that even though she gives a very little information in general about like her

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
life. All of us are wrapped up in her personal business to thing like absolute everybody's thirsty for

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
photos or video of her wedding when her baby came everybody was just like I need to know more about

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
this child immediately pretty much like anything having to her personal life causes some sort

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
of media frenzy.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
So the brings us to our next stage. Yes determining if a lemonade

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
is autobiographical or simply art.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
So our next clip is from an E.S.P.N. pod cast called Jane win in

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Jacoby So it's a sports and pop culture show hosted by retired N.B.A. player Jane

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
rose and sports commentator David Jacoby So in this clip. They are addressing

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
the debate over whether or not lemonade is autobiographical. Or you know just a

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
piece of art that the anti put out there for all of us to take and says here is Jaylen telling

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
David his theory beyond say has become a global

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
superstar and has selectively used her

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
voice over this period of time. She's always stay classy.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
She's always been dissed

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
disciplined and she's always been calculating very calculated same with Jay Z..

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Both of them are masters. OK There's a reason why

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
they're elite at what they do. I'm taking this as her and

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Jay Z. are too intelligent to air so much dirty

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
laundry when they just had a daughter. You remember when they were on tour.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Do you remember what dominated that summer's

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
headlines. Oh they're going to divorce are the retorts. Hoochie on what's happening.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
They were in the headlines all summer long to else they were in the money because that's how

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
this works. I want to say that I learned a couple of things you

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
never judge what's going on to someone

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
else's relationship. You know there's only two people as knows that know what's going on in relationship in those are the

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
people involved no one else has a hundred of the story. No one in the world no matter how much you think you know you

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.000
don't

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
know your best friend male or female is not telling you

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
everything that they talk about

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
with their me you know they're giving you one side. They're not altering it.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
That's why Scott pillow talk. You're not around and so what I

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
truly

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000
think is this is beyond say being an artist.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Just like when you go to a movie. Somebody is reading a script

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
and they are playing it out for public consumption. They put something I

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:51.000
don't sell of

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
in jail and you think they made the whole thing up.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
I am not Roland you think they

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
made this illegal. You ready for this tell me because I think if it was

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
this deep at the end of that

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
documentary it will be her packing her

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
stuff.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
OK yeah.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Which side of this argument. Are you on do you think that it's like do you think it's fact.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Actually I haven't had to say this out loud. Yet I've just been like thinking about this in my head for ever since it came

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
out because we're getting exclusive Yes. Truth is. I feel like

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
it's largely autobiographical. And I feel like there might be some parts.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.000
I

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
do try to do that was funny. What that was like a while.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
It just seems like if this isn't autobiographical then

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Jay Z. is a really good and brave man to put

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
himself in this

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
position to be heavily scrutinized and

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
like villainize in the media across the country in like

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
barbershops beauty shows whatever you

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
like if this isn't real. Then he is a he's a really really

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
good dude for being able to take this on did you when you first watched it did you watch it while

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
tweeting a few

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
times so for personal reasons. Somebody made me go

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
out and leave the house. Oh on Saturday and I was on the house I live two thousand and fifteen

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
crying frame to where I was going but I came back at like four and I was

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
like seven watching right

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
now so I watched it without anybody like tweeting or anything like that. Oh when I

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
took it in it was just me by myself. Yeah whining

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
like you know why because I have spent all this money on title crime because

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
of making myself committing to watching an hour

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
long visual masterpiece. When I was obviously sleepy. I thought the infidelity stuff

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
was like allegory. I actually didn't think it was like for real.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Also the other things are getting. On every six months she

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
does I was finally getting when she was like oh you cheated on me I was like I know you said about this you say well this is

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
your fifteen years old son. OK whatever interests but then the

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
next day I sort of I got caught up on Twitter and then I realized a lot of people really thought that this thing

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
was real Yeah. And then upon like six more viewings. You know which I did

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
happily there are a couple parts in the beginning or beyond that was so angry. Yeah that I

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
was

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
like. You might actually not be

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
exactly exactly. I was just like hola like she's you

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
know throwing her ring at the caravan like you know loser wife you pull this shit like she

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
was it just seemed very pointed and like even and sorry at the

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
end where she says big homie. You know better grow up like that is obvious

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
obviously Jay Z's nickname. So it's like she's putting very specific pronouns in

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
like phrases and very pointed visual effects. It

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
makes it seem like this is very personal and very

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
real so I saw more of like just the difficulty and anger and pain come or loneliness

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
that can come from just terrible

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
things that's what I latched onto when I watched them initially as much as

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
I do enjoy celebrity gossip.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
I still kind of was

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
like that actually matter it you know I mean like does it actually matter whether or not it's autobiographical art.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
I personally don't think it matters I think that her message remains the

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
same you know it's about infidelity it's about accountability responsibility.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
People should China to focus on the gossip parts if possible I know it's sexy but it has no

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
bearing on the actual content that she put

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
out there. This idea of whether or not beyond say work as is fact or

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
fiction autobiographical really like her intent

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
and integrity as an artist serve intertwined with this whole conversation is like the question

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
of the anti authenticity which we will talk more

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000
about

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
after the break. OK the whole past thought. I

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
will and we will be

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
right back with more lemon May I try to practice all these different ways of

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
saying I mean. I'm into

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:21.000
it

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
more

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:30.000
or

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
this week's episode of sampler is brought to you by sundown Senna's is a smart wireless

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
speaker system that super easy to set up with so knows you can stream all your favorite music or

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
pod casts to any room or every room in your home and you can set up your

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
center system so that anyone can control play

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
with Britney from here from a different package to tell you a thing about so

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
now it's already. OK so every single day of my life goes into the Amazon soundtrack. So as

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
my girlfriend every day I actually hate to disappoint them as their shoes are doing this thing. Which

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
is she is astonishing on

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
her phone. So when I'm in the shower she will just change the song halfway through the song

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
to The Boys Are Back

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
In Town by like fiddle as if yes by

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Finley during our marriage now by how by now.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
It's like getting slapped in the face by like a four year old I have Selena Sims two free tickets

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
for you was like the soundtrack to something that happens on stage that they cannot see enough times like

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
I just don't I don't feel bad for you but I do hear you saying though is that there

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
is even one more potential benefit to using center speakers. You can

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
totally torment your boyfriend which is something I'm gonna keep on file.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
So I came in here to do one P.S.A. and a different

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
P.S.A. to learn more about so no Skoda

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Sonus dot com slash sampler That's S O N O S dot com

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000

sampler sampler is brought to you by frame

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
bridge so I've got a picture of my law. They guess what

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
ensuring my husband and I and front of the altar where

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Elvis married

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
us that Courtney she's a frame bridge customer in her wedding photo. She's standing at

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
the altar beaming at her future husband who's beaming back at her even Elvis

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
looks thrilled but that perfect moment was just

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
that a moment right before her marriage began and the day we called

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
her was a far cry from perfection

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
and got two four year olds with a stomach bug. As of last night although

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
my husband's going and for emergency oral surgery in about an hour. Things are a little

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
crazy on a day like today. Courtney looks at that perfect wedding photo and thinks about

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
how far they've

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
come just all the the hard work we've put in we've both had marriages

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
before two very young children and not easy bringing young kids into a

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
new house together and we open a business a year ago. So we've just been

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
very busy and I feel very lucky to be where we

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
So welcome back to sampler in the studio with me I have Quiana

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Fitzgerald and N.P.R. Music and no one know she recently reviewed beyond

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
his album Beyond his visual

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
masterpiece lemonade. For N.P.R. So at the end the first half of

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
the show we talked about whether or not it's

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
autobiographical that kind of is connected to this idea of how

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
authentic beyond a is or how authentic or her image

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000
is set brings us to and. Stage says he cannot make implications.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
You see that will kill me.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
So this next clip comes from talk poverty radio. It's a show that examines

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
issues around poverty in this country it's co-hosted by Tracy Ross and Rebecca Valis of

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
the Center for American Progress. The first voice you'll hear in this clip is host

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Tracy followed by her c.a.p colleague Maryam Adama and Constance Tori

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
and they're talking about the imagery Bianchi has been using in her most recent

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
work and what it means from a socio economic

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
perspective the one thing that I've thought about I've heard other

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
people say things because apparently all I do is just read about beyond that but I've heard other

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
people say things like well you know how is this woman who is in a billion

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
dollar

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
family going to try and connect to you know embrace cultures

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
that aren't hers even if it's lower income people in the U.S. Those sorts

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
of things by having her walking through Norland walking through Amr her old

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
hometown into Houston Texas.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
But as I was on the show all the time the

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
average African-American family making one hundred thousand dollars a year in

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
this country lived in a more disadvantaged neighborhood than the average white family

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
making thirty thousand dollars a

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
year and so I feel like despite the fact that her paycheck is now out of the

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
stratosphere black people in his country like regard list of

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
class are in these sorts of communities that she features

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
throughout the

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
video and so for me I mean when you say in the Third Ward third world connection.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
I mean I think it's very real that regardless of your stature

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
in society if you're a black person you're going to be in the places that are suffering the

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
most so I

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
it's not only you it's like your family or your Exactly family that I don't I don't buy that

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
like B.S.A. doesn't understand like a low income black

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
life like. I'm not saying that like she lived on a day to day basis

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
but I feel like kind of what you're saying like your social world is like a black person and I think it's like kind

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
of always being tied to like multi-day income level men like various

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
situation and like even me like in my like comfortable like American life I have

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
like tons of family members living in Nigeria who are in deep poverty.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000
I like to live in a

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
town that's like the fastest shrinking in America. So like I like can

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
both like I think visually people be like oh you know young professional like my social world

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
back home and where my physical home is located is like one of the poor struggling towns

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
in like the outskirts of the Mississippi Delta So

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
like it's really hard to like make those distinctions I think

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
specifically and I also think that people been asking that you know that we also become a little bit

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
more real for some time now to be human and notice that she's paying attention I think the entire time

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
I watched as I was like No she's real she's paying attention you realize all the struggles.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
So it's like do you want her to say something or not because now we're talking about it and we weren't before and like she's

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
going to it seems like she's going to keep making us talk about it what I think is really important so I don't know I

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
don't get mad that she's representing or putting things in lemonade that she might not live on a

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
daily basis because I think that helps like again expose things to people who aren't don't think of things that

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
way so she said some people have gotten mad that she

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
is representing for lower income

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
people so

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
well when you think. Well I think

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
that what she did with this visual

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
album in terms of focusing on focusing very

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
very directly on the way that black people live in this

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
country which in the clip largely is either. Binny's or very near

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
the poverty line or even if they are at a higher class

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:02.000
monetary early they still will be in situations where they're not in the best environments. So.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
It's obviously something that has been screamed about in this country in certain rooms

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
and conversations for decades and for somebody like her at

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
her level to very directly put these women who look like my mom

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
and my aunt and my sister like these women that I very strongly identify

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
with for her to do that I feel was very very necessary

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
and I don't think that there's any reason for anybody to think that she's inauthentic for doing that

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
if anything it's the complete

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
opposite the other thing that I think that a lot of people don't realize a lot of non-black people don't

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
realize is that in the United States so far people have freedom for so

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
long and so you have it when you haven't had the opportunity to build generational welfare at

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
the outside seems like she grew up middle class upper middle class but the chances are really high

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
that like her parents did not and also that like her family was not in that economic class

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
for her entire lifetime absent I know that that's that way for my family like my older sister six years

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
old and I

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
am the way that my family my family was living when my sister was young it's completely different

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
in the way that my family was living when when I was like we're six. Yes you know six seven eight

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
nine Tolly different than it was for my older

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
sister because like when you don't have like generational welfare when you don't have like generations

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
of your family being able to attend college or like even just like

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
attain professional skills or even like I think of like my grandfather even though he served in

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
military and like got a four year degree he still had to go get like an

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
additional certificate mortuary science because it was like difficult to get a job

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
you know he's from Mississippi. So like a family of the generation that the I think grew up

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:41.000
in

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
like your economic status can change over time and then also if you factor

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
in you know family you know I'm saying family bloodline friends.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Yeah friends cousins like oncet uncles not everybody in

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Bianchi's family is living at her level period and is now if you cut off from them I. We've

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
seen the pictures of her like weddings and like family gatherings and stuff like she is out

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
here in spaces where she is not

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
like on Jetson on yachts like she's not always in that setting so I

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
think it's ridiculous and unfair for people to like say that no you can only speak about

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.000
this

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
small you know sector of society is beyond say spring real action in

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
terms of where you can just change in thought in terms of how people think about poverty. Do you think

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
that like there's something to her placing herself in a context where people don't think that they

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
see not just her but even a black woman like her maybe you know I'm saying.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
I think she

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
absolutely is most identifiably I think for

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
mation like you know when she's in the beauty shop or the beauty supply store and she has the

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
black girls with a different color hair and I think one of them's worn a silk wrap or whatever in

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
same situation with don't hurt herself in the visual album when she has that moment where she has a

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Malcolm X.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
clip disrespected in

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
America

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:13.000
that

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
she very deliberately I feel uses

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
shots of women that look normal or that look like the women that you think is too

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
loud on the subway or you think like oh I don't want her you know sitting next to me on the bus

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
like these are real women and I feel like her very you know

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
deliberately putting them in the front of the camera in the way that she did

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
was an attempt if anything to like show people like yeah these are a

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
grown humans and you can talk to them and they have emotions and they deserve to be protected.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
It also makes me think about like just judging by like all general litmus test of the Internet

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
you know a lot of people have very little concept of the answer being a black woman like any other black woman.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Yeah and I think that in putting yourself in different contexts and bringing women

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
from context. People

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
assume that beyond say does not ever enter into by putting

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
herself like aligning herself with those women. Yeah and aligning those women with her she sort of thing

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
like what's any different like there's nothing different about me then

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
these women inside the beauty supply store Yeah there's not even the fact that she had a

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
shot but you don't know what the inside of you to sign over looked like crazy to

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
me that's my whole life

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
and literally every everything

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
goal Sunday after church we went to the beach there wasn't there were any good ones out in

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Farmington Hills Michigan. No that we wouldn't went to teach right church.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
You have to really go through the simple leave you supply

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
of which there are ten thousand in this trade

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
area but I'm actually glad you brought up hay or

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
yes because that kind of connects to actually directly some Thanks to our next clip

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
which brings us actually to our final phase crazy. Yes our final

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000
face which I'm sure you've experienced and I have experienced explaining.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Lemonade to white people.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
So this next clip is from Buzz Feed's another round which is hosted by Tracy Clayton

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
and having got two friends at the show who have appeared on samples before. So in this

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
episode their guest is writer Nicole

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Perkins and it's a three of them talking about this one specific line of lemonade

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
arguably the most famous line of the album.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
You better call back to

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
the cynical and have an interest see are all talking about these like

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
think pieces that came out after the album which were about this line and how it

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:44.000
was supposedly racially charged or reverse racism or whatever and.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
One celebrity in specific who was getting all caught up in the meaning of the line.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
The first stories we're going to hear is Heaven's followed by Tracy.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:53.000
First of

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
all

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
when I got home. Baccy that's offensive.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Do you think

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
down near you.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
But there is just there isn't and I feel like white girls do this thing where like they know they're not

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
a part of something like not explicitly about me so I'm going to turn the attention to

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
about yeah and there's this like there are these articles that like to Mbeki with the

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
good thing that happened earlier

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
the camera thing British Glamour are well taken back Becky or

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
something I didn't back baccy.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
This also now you know when the phrase didn't happen

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
when basic The phrase or the word BASIC was blah. Mind you know what let me

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
recall. I finally found my oppression All

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
my God I find it so wild how white people

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
cannot consume a product that is not at least where the rest of the world has been

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
doing that their entire lives and they can even quietly not can write and you can

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
just hit play right now you could just not sweet you think you cannot write a

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
novel article may cost you nothing.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Free ninety nine.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
This is also show me that white people have no idea what good hair is or what I

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
mean I like these know they're here is an

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
excellent analogy but I think

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
what I haven't said You tweeted that Becky with the good hair is actually a state

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
of ideas or something let's say I'm going to stand. I don't

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
know why that agree with that I think that she's just

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
really there somebody other. Yeah. And my mother who's going

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
to hate me that I'm saying you know my mother is like yeah B.R. say

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
she got some rough stuff so I mean by that

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000
I don't you know I never said that behind not come for us.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Not to be I don't want to say I'm doing things or my

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
mother Mama.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
But I think do you think a back you can. A failure what. I think this is

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
how the US They threw us off because of the history of good here. It's

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
what's closest to whiteness. Right right and so you don't need to

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
qualify white daddy. It's a given. Yeah

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000
right. So I feel like that he is a definite reference to whiteness.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:21.000
I think

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
that people who are deemed quote not black enough are like some sort of like

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
quote exotic black or whatever

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
and they the implication is that they are not like

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
in touch with like they're brown and so whatever then they too can be considered the

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
baccy that is how I interpret the Emmy to I don't because you would because white girls not have good hair white girls

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
have white right.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
You know well we know how to get Why grow

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
hair. We hope for good hair right now there's not a characteristic that an actual baccy

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
would have I don't

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
think agreed. Yeah. I love the Nicole

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
in that clip said beyond see threw us off with that line because Becky

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000
and good hair very separate ideas because like Becky is obviously

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000
like I'm sorry like you get the fuck over but like Biggie is like a word that is

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
used to kind of encapsulate a white woman or a white girl and then you have good hair which is

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
like it's very situated in the black community. So as they said it's more

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
about how close can you get to whiteness not whiteness. Period. Like I don't think I've ever

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:24.000
heard anybody

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
say white people have good hair. No disrespect but like that's not something that's ever been uttered in

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
my presence. It's always been about how loose is your curl

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
pattern how Sukey is sure is your hair.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
So that's kind of beyond say throwing us off and I also agree with the fact

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
that it's more of an idea of like the other woman she's just saying like. Go get the

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
girl over there that's what you really want.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
She's not saying that is a white girl or she's not saying that it is X. Y. or Z. It's

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
just like a way that she's presenting this other

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
woman I kind of took it that same way I took it as like she's just like. She's been cheated

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
on who she is being as rude as humanly

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
possible outs and like me myself personally I feel like

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
I'm for those of you who are just tuning in I'm black.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Yeah I have I have

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
dated many people in the past who

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
had how to put it like who had issues with their own identity and try to impress those

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
things upon me and definitely would

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
like date me knowing full well obviously that you know they could see. Yeah

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
and they can hear that I'm black but like it became very clear as like your dating them that

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
that that's not what they were looking for at all they were looking for that he was a good here and you know when

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
I broke up with these people I said any number of nonsensical

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
rude parable of mean inflammatory things

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
just to let them know like is it like I like it I guess it like it when identified with went beyond So I said

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
that is sort of just

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
like you obviously have some sort

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
of like this is your predilection this is what you're into this may have been what you thought you

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
were signing up for when you met me this is not what you're getting into That's what you want was that she has

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
a whole like verse and the the interludes that was

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
written by poet worsened Shire where she's like you know if you want.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Like I can where you know her skin as my

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
skin her hair off

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
my hand as

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:35.000
close

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
as

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
I start on my be

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
down it struck me as like if this is what you want you can have

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
that and then you can also choke on your own spin and die. That's sort of how I took Becky with the good hair.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
I think it was a friend of mine who tweeted she's like it's so so. If you don't know who Becky with a good hair

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
is this probably

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
is. The accuracy. Oh yeah

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
and that's like

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
another thing that I really loved about this album is that she

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
did insert these like little you know like side phrases that only a

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
certain group of people would know that what she's talking

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
about or even like in sorry same song right. Yeah you know

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
she's like singing the hook and she's like I mean sorry and she says nigger now like she's being

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
very deliberate about how she is presenting these songs when she chooses

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000
to say Becky with good hair or the inn or whatever like damn you know I'm just like OK girls

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:33.000
I see

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
you and everything. That's all I can say.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Well he wanna play our clips I know.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:44.000
So

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
like now that we've gone through our phases. How are you feeling.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
I feel very relieved because I got to say way more things about this.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
That I didn't get to in like a four minute review. So it made me

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
really think about certain parts of the album that I wasn't that I hadn't

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000
accessed you know I'm going to leave here and watch it all over again and go through many

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
emotions and have a great day

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
hopefully. Well thank you so much for coming on the show this is great you're

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:28.000
fantastic thank yous is like the most fun I've had in a long time.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:28.000
You

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000
can follow N.P.R. Music's Quiana Fitzgerald on Twitter at piano

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000
that and to recap the clips you have heard through all our stages of

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
consuming lemonade the I'm bridled enthusiasm for B.S.A. came from the

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
read the unlikely pairing of campaign strategy and lemonade

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
mania came from Slate strong

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000
cast. The theory on Jay Z's a likely infidelity came from the E.S.P.N. podcast.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Jaylen engine probably the analysis of the socio economic implications of the on

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000
face imagery came from talk. Poverty radio and the explanation of Bacchis

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000
and good hair was from Buzz Feed's another round.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
We played a lot of clips today and

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000
listen when you head over to i Tunes to listen to lemonade for the first or fiftieth time.

show and it lets us know what you think about it so you know. Just go do it great

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
fanfare on i Tunes and then continue listening to lemonade on

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000
repeat and a quick note on last week's show we incorrectly Aidid a voice in

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
one of our clips. He played a clip from the podcast. Flash forward which featured
