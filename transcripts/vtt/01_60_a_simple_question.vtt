There's a sort of reply I was brought to you by audible dot com Audible dot com provides over one hundred eighty

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
thousand audiograms from a leading audio book

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
publishers one book they have as Paul had which is a collection of essays by National Magazine Award winner

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
John Jeremiah salt and it is so good. There's a story where he goes to try

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
to cover the crossover Festival which is an enormous Christian rock festival and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
things kind of immediately go

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
haywire and stand at the edge of the crowd and take notes on the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
scene trot up the occasional audience member. What's harder home schooling or

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
regular school and then flash mob boss to get backstage word

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
wrap with the artists themselves.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
He ends up renting an R.V. He tries to find a Christian rock fan to be his copilot.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000

last week my colleague Alex Goldman provided technical support to a woman who lost her domain name

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and wanted it back. Alex is out this week and so I am stepping up to provide super technical support.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So this starts very simply with an email from a guy named Mack time live in

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Brooklyn Metro to say that all he wanted was to sign up for a high speed internet.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
New York City.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
He wanted the service called Firehouse which is just Internet over fiber optic cables. It's

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
mostly insanely fast fries and sells it and so he called Horizon.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I had like checkers rising to see if I could get service of mine new apartment

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and like I said I think they don't say no but they kind

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
of do like we'll get back to you.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Yeah but fast forward a little while I get something in the mail saying

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
like that they're offering service and I'm like are a crate I'm going to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
like call them up and like give them so install it

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and it doesn't go anywhere I eventually

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
get something the mail saying that like we've tried to get in touch

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
with your landlord to install service our engineers are working

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.000
on

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
it and that was like weird because according to Matt.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
He has the rarest thing in New York. He has an exceptionally good

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
landlord like if I complain about the leaky sink. He actually shows up and fixes that which

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
you know by New York standards it's crazy Hell

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly like in my past experience have been leaky

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
saying why are you calling us. So so it's like I mean it's a he's like

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
buy on a weekly basis and like if there's something to talk about like we talk about

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
it so why wouldn't a good landlord want his tenant to have incredibly fast

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
internet didn't make any sense. I called Matt's landlord up to ask his name

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
is Fred.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Hi

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
this is P.J. calling Matthew put me in touch with you right.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Yes Fred said Verizon wasn't telling the truth. He said he's never heard anything from them about Matt. Moreover.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
He says he had called Horizon on his own to ask about Vyas and they told him the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
same thing they need to get permission from the owner of the building. Did you tell them that you're

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
the owner of the building.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Whoever I spoke to. Asked me today I thought I was the one of the building yes when I spoke to

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
guess and what they say they said that they just don't do they just they just

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
myself and I have a right

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
now and would you want rising to install files in your buildings if they

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
could

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I would liken the files more so than you know

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
the dishes that you have had one. You know. When you go it isn't all that other stuff you know I would fight fight fire

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
with more than yes they have said

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
yes so Matt said he knows that sometimes with stories like this

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
when reporters start asking questions. Everything somehow just get streamlined for the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
person who's making trouble and he said he didn't want that that would be right.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Yeah like a like honestly like if I were to mysteriously get service and then like the people upstairs really couldn't

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
get service like their be part of me heard but there was one I like I don't know.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Well I guess I could still use the service but I don't much hate the more I would hate them more and I

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
would just like myself or likes the idea that. Yeah that's the

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
other that's definitely how I feel about

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that and this it turns out is why Matt really wanted to protect

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
support. Not for me to magically get him via So instead he wanted something that

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
was way more difficult.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
He wanted something that I have wanted so many times in my life while dealing with some massive

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Internet company.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Matt wanted an answer he wanted to

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
know why did rising treat him that way. Had they made a mistake. Had they

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
lied to him and if so why this seemed to me kind of like

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
a hopeless request but it resonated with me and so I started to poke

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
around and it turns out in New York City. There are actually a ton of people with maps

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
problem people who don't have those and who want it. They want it with the kind

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
of fervor that people usually reserve for new i Phones or opening night Star Wars

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
tickets in two thousand and thirteen. I found out. Yes

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
BIOS was available in my neighborhood. So I called the number that was.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Inserted in my bill. Yes I want files sign me

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
up that was in two thousand and thirteen.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
That was such an exciting moment. Yes Would you like to find out when I got fired.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I would love to hear when you got fired. It is now two thousand and sixteen.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I still don't have it. This is Patricia lake

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
in reply our producer C.N.N. spoke to her she was on the Upper West Side

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
but by now it became my mission exists.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It's in my neighborhood. I wanted I want to be able to save money and have faster

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Internet connection.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So let me tell you what it is like to live in New York City.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Everywhere you look is an advertisement for

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Firehouse genius and Michael Bay director of Hollywood hits such

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.000
as

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Transformers as on T.V. there's ads on the radio. There's ads on the Internet with streaming and papa.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
There are flyers they get shoved under your door getting presents us with us on the billboard on the back

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
of the newspaper. It is in the eyes of the people who you love it is written in the night

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
sky in the stars. It is

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
inescapable. What happened with the rising sun fiberoptic Street to

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
you. On every single Verizon truck in in bold and

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
is filed. You know on the sides of the truck so it's certainly something

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
that is being promoted for

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
sure and how do you feel when you see that ha ha ha.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
You know it's like yeah right torture.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Maybe this sounds like hyperbole but for me and for most the people I know it makes sense

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
because New York is a slow internet

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
health everything here just trickles using the

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Internet is like sitting in Times Square at five o'clock in rush hour. All the

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
time watching Netflix is like slowly flipping a picture

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
book and any time you start using it is just think this is normal things take time to

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
load whatever you tell

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
yourself. When you see an ad for fire

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
that's

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
right he makes this promise

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
to you that it doesn't have to be like that and you can't help

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
but wish that you had it that everybody had it that the mayor would pass a decree

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
guaranteeing Vios for all New Yorkers you get by

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
if you get fired. Now I know what you're saying there's no way that would ever

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
happen but your listener you are

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
wrong because in two thousand eight thousand signed a contract with the

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
city that they would make Fi OS available to any resident who wanted

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
it and they said that they would do that by the summer of two thousand and fourteen.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
This is Josh mom he works for a progressive nonprofit group called a common

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
cause even if you were the only person in your apartment building who wanted it. They still had

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
to and they had to go up the elevator shaft and get in there. Anon which would have been a

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
nonstandard insolation the still had to do that you still had the right to

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
request files and have it

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
installed so in theory this utopia should have showed up two years ago but Matt doesn't

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
have even though he wants it. Patricia doesn't have IOS you know she wants it

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
and when the city looked into this they found out that there's at least forty thousand people

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
who've requested by us and haven't gotten it. After waiting for more than a year so nobody knows for

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
sure why this is happening.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Every talk to Matt. I started trying to find somebody at Verizon who talk to me which is not easy to do

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
it turns out and more on that later but in the meantime Maggies me

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
his theory for what was going on he knows that some people are going fast. And his theory is

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
that horizon only wants to sell to rich people.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Matisse live in Williamsburg which is a very expensive neighborhood and when he lived there. He actually did

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.000
have

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
eyes when I didn't stalled in Williamsburg a guy came shoulder hole in the side of the

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
building but the fiber through it and like that was it. There was no getting in contact with a

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
landmark like and felt like just regular

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
cable you think that they're much more interested installing in the expensive neighborhood than in

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
the less expensive one.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
But what was that is like one hundred

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
percent. I don't know part of it. I

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
have no doubts. Yeah.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
This makes sense to me because when you sign up for any kind of Internet.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
The company also will try to sell you a T.V. package and a phone line all these other

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
services that come through that same wire and so I could imagine

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
that maybe they'd want to serve rich people first because rich people maybe they wouldn't just pay

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
eighty bucks a month for internet. They also might pay like another hundred bucks for the really good cable

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
package or like sixty more bucks for the sports package. Maybe they don't just want H.B.O. want an easier

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
to maybe they want you know H.B.O. one through nine.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I mean they're trying to maximize the revenue like so they have it one level like you might have sales people who aren't going

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
to fight the push that maybe that's why they like yeah maybe people whose job all day is like

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
how many triple plays that you closed today. You know how big like in the water cooler.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
That would have been against the rules they had to give to everybody not just the rich people and who knows if that's what

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
they were doing these are just guesses.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Now

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Josh is a slightly different way of looking at this whole mysterious problem. I should

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
say that his group usually toggles much bigger problems.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Stuff like Citizens United

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
but fires ended up on his plate after a lot of common cause members complained that they couldn't get

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
it and so now they've become sort of experts about why people in the U.S. have such a

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Bismillah the slow

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Internet not just in New York but in many places. So here's what I learned

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
from Josh that actual process of wiring a city for internet. It's really really expensive up front.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
You've got to do all this construction but once you've done it you make a ton of money off people's

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
subscriptions governments don't want to spend all that up front money

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and so they let companies do it but before any wires

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
get put down they'll make deals with the companies they'll say if you're going to give Internet to people

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
where we live.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
It's got to be this faster you've got. Give them this deal or you've got to pay us some of the

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
money

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and that moment before the wire gets laid that is a moment where the government has a

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
ton of power.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
If you live somewhere where your internet sucks. It probably started sucking when one of

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
those deals got

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
made and that's why Internet across so much of the United States just seems

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
to

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
crawl specially when you compare that

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
to Internet service around the world and how affordable

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and fast. It's even in places like Ball

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Garia is Internet really faster in Bulgaria.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Yes. It's much faster and I think in some places like.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Like South Korea I think it's about thirty megabytes per second again. I mean what is it in

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
like in Hatton and it's also of the average Internet speed

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Manhattan.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
What do you

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
have what do I have that you have bios. That's going

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
to think

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
that we have files seriously.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Yeah you know we off i OS I think one other thing they did was they went to bigger like.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Downtown office buildings where the slab you know. Where in lower Manhattan there's a lot of nonprofits here

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
that like start up groups that are here.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
So I think they wanted to make sure that those areas were wired

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
first and let's just

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
say this by the way was actually the first time I'd

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
gotten to see Fi OS what it actually looked like and it seemed fast.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Normally if I'd type in a U.R.L. and I hit

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Enter I'm used to this little pause. It's like three to five seconds. I

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
just wait and Josh browser didn't have that cache by the way we're

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
on this website has your speed. There are five ads for of rising by as there are five

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
banner ads around this speed

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
test for sixty nine dollars a month.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
So you're seeing. An ad for that they have. It's

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
crazy advertising part of it I know it doesn't seem like such a big

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
deal but it just I'm so curious about it it's like a store being out of stock

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
or something but they're just putting up all these ads telling people to come by like those customers

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
don't come and get something else they don't come and they're not happy like it that is the

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
part that actually confuse me more than

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
anything I mean you know that we had stories of a guy he said there's a Verizon

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
truck that parks outside of he lives in Manhattan the so there's a fries and truck that parked

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
outside of my house every single day and I cannot

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000
get installed the rising truck it's a file strike its files all over it.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
The promotional truck that just sits there

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
he's gone out and talk to people the trucking says give me if I want it. There's this

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
other thing that I've heard about the justice could not explain when Verizon first signed

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
the contract by all accounts they've been

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
great did wired files for the people who wanted it things had been

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
normal but then after a year or so installations ground to a halt.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
It seemed like there was a clue in that but Josh can explain why it

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
happened.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
See the biggest didn't they help you.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Hi this is P.J. Vo com back for Bob master called

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000
up

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
so I called Bob Master Bob we're sure the communications were fishing and so he represents

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
the guys who work for horizon. If you actually install fast and Bob said yes at a

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
certain point files inflation's have gotten very

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
weird our members. Yeah they just they just do what they're told to do right. But they

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
they know when it's being done right and when it's being done

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
wrong in every borrow if ever some reason Staten Island their bosses would tell them to go why are the

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
main avenues. But then they wouldn't tell them to wire the side

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
streets guys from the Lower East Side you know they go up first Avenue they go up Second Avenue the building

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
the side streets because you've got to go building by building and wire the. All tenement buildings

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and companies didn't want to invest the investor resources.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
So from Bob's perspective. It looked like Verizon was doing the bare minimum and Bob himself

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
will say that he has a bias here ever rising and falls more lines that's more it for his union

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
members

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
but he also said this other thing he doesn't matter was wrong about Verizon just

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
being interested in rich customers because he said if you really looked at which streets got

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
skipped it was a simple as rich neighborhoods versus poor neighborhoods.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
It has not in our view just been an issue

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
of economic discrimination. Right

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
because there are pretty wealthy neighborhoods for

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
example like dimiss park and Prospect Park South and Park

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Slope that do not have Fi OS It appears to

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
us that the company simply did not want to

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
invest in the the cost of labor that it would take to build

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
out

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
universally Bob says here is the theory that he heard from his union members. The

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
rumor is that Fi OS is basically the victim of a regime change within fries then this

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
whole ambitious crazy planned to wire New York with BIOS it started with

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
this guy Ivan Seidenberg he was C.E.O. of

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Arisan Seidenberg was the C.E.O. until I don't know exactly when to let two thousand and eleven two thousand and

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
ten he came out of the wireline company. He was and he was

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
a New York tell my next

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
guy so cyber cases big risk he puts a time of money behind Fi

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
OS he's convinced it's going to be the next big thing but then

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
in two thousand and eleven the board tells Seidenberg that he is no longer

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
C.E.O. then the guy had a wireless name Lomo Gadamer the current C.E.O. takes

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
over he's a wireless guy and he's like why are we spending our money on this this is this was the

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000
theory right. Yeah. And our members speculated that there was kind of a shift in philosophy.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
One additional fact that might support this at about the same time the new C.E.O. took over.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
The installation slow down there are more complaints to the city about people not getting

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
service. And it turned out that while the agreement had said risin had to give almost everybody

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
follows it hadn't really spelled out any penalties if they just didn't follow through.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
So it's possible risin thought that. They could get away with it and nobody would really notice or care.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
After all the merit the time was Bloomberg who is pretty pro-business and not like a huge regulation

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
guy but then in two thousand and thirteen Blasio is like New

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.000
York's

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
mayor our approach is going to be bold and it's going to be decisive because we simply haven't done

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
well enough in the city. The goal is quite simple we must have

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
universal affordable high speed Internet access throughout this city it's as simple as

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
that and Blasio during the campaign he kept talking about how the Internet

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
is a human right how

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
everybody should have fast Internet. Specifically he had saying that Verizon was falling down on

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
the job but it was who gets

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
elected and suddenly fries and is in trouble. They're ordered to come

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
to this hearing and it's this hearing where the city basically just be

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
temporizing for four hours.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Now let me first say we just received this this is not your testimony right.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
It's a brief. Hello yes. Yes You know I don't know if you're going to be told this I don't know you better get me

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
No-Doz but.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
I have never watched a city council hearing before but if they were like this all the time I would

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
watch one every night the city council members are

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
just pounding on this rising fact because the city has found out that when customers call

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
to ask for Firehouse rising doesn't say we haven't wired your home yet but we're

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
on our way they just tell us a lot of the customers isn't available in your

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
neighborhood period.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
And then sometimes not only do they do that but they try to sell them satellite T.V..

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
The city's mad and one of the council members Brad lander. He says he even called that

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
very day.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
I don't mean to make this my customer service request I talk to all. Lovely woman

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
named Stacy and I don't mean to get her in trouble will talk about her training in a minute

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
but do you want to guess at what Stacy told me about the availability

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
of files so on at my house on Thirteenth Street between fourth and fifth

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
the lander as it's barely suppressed smile in the face he looks like someone who's

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
halfway through a prank phone call and then the camera cuts to these two varieties and representatives

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
who do not look like they're having fun.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
I'd rather not. OK I don't mean for us to get a feel for me and I

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
quote I was going to record it so I could play it for you but I assume you have it recorded

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
file is unavailable your address at this time

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
I asked when it would be available.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
She did not she said honestly I don't know and she certainly did not offer me a

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
nonstandard installation or any other

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
approach. Now I don't want to get her in trouble it sounds to me like you're saying the problem is

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
not that files is unavailable at my house the problem is that Stacy didn't say

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
to me Mr Landor it's available in your neighborhood just not to

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
you that was I'm

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
just that's what that's

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
what should have happened this you should have told me she was wrong to tell me it was

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
unavailable the craziest part of the hearing is when they get to the part about the

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
apartments that didn't want five. These are apartments where Verizon was supposed to just pass the wire by

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
their house in case somebody wanted it

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
or it turns out a lot of those trees aren't

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:36.000
wired even though Verizon had told the city that they'd filled their side of the deal.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
And so Brad Lander the same city council member from

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
before he says it sounds like you had your own definition one passed but it

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
seems incredible that you never mention

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
that

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
you included in your testimony. Well actually one question I was looking at the franchise

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
agreement and it defines a lot of terms this agreement you have a

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
defined public right of. Way multiple dwelling unit normal business hours

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
persons subscriber and even defined borough

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
president in the franchise agreement does it define

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
past. No it does not it does not

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
define pass.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
So the city tells risin that if they don't follow the agreement the city will sue

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
them and publicly Verizon doesn't apologize or miss any wrongdoing but

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
this message seems to get through because afterwards. Everybody agrees that things just

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
quietly get better.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Bob the guy from the union said that Bryson started taking workers from other places in New

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
York like upstate and forcing them to relocate to New York for weeks at a time to try to install more

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Fi OS

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
lines and the City said that the number of complaints they were getting from people who just couldn't get

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Vyas the complaint start to go down. I talk to my Wiley who's the marriage lawyer and

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
it's her job now to make sure that rising follows the rules. She says is working

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
but even now even she says that she does not understand why they didn't want to do it in

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
the first

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
place right at the end of the day they make money by getting customers. That's why this

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
whole process has been astounding in some respects because it only

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
benefits them to do everything in their power to get that

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
fiber out there and get more people

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
online and I'm looking forward to seeing them

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
act more in line with their business interests.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
When I die the only thing I want to get to do is to be a ghost in that building and

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
know if like all these decisions came out of like if they were like ha ha ha ha. I will make so

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
much money by not doing this or if it was just confused people kind of messing up

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
a job. I honestly and I want to say I think

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
that I think there are some committed people to rise and so I don't want to you know paint fry him

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
with one nasty brush we want them to be successful.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
I think that there are some examples of where they had to tighten up shop.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
I think that there are questions about. What level of commitment they had to continuing file's rollout.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
I think that they are demonstrating more commitment now which is gratifying. But I agree

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
with you I think there's a fascinating book to be written.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Yeah the central irony of the story for me is I've never seen a story where people are

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000
saying please take eighty dollars a month for me please.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
And have then you know you will charge me more money.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Well because you know they want think about it you know one of the problems we have in the city and it's one of the

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
reasons we need more competition is we pay more for

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
less you know if we're a lot of folks we lived

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:38.000
in Seoul

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Korea or Amsterdam. We'd be getting significantly

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
faster speeds at significantly lower prices and that's because you know they may

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
have maybe five providers in the market to serve every one customer instead of one to

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
two providers. So

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:02.000
I I'm looking forward to the opportunity to plop down my eighty dollars a month.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Have you genuinely called to just try to get Fi OS for your house as a

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
civilian I actually went online to the website. I had a heck of a time

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
I tried three times getting online filed my my request for

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
service at one point there were issues with even being able to find the part of the website where

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
you could request the service. So I've raised that with them although the end of the day

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000
I made clear I'm not arguing that my neighborhood be done first.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.000
My

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
I actually had advice for what Matt could do to get his Internet fixed to get a fix the way he

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
wants it fixed for everybody. She basically said he should call three one one that if the city got

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
a bunch of complaints from his neighborhood the naked yelled rise and they could make sure that his neighborhood got

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
service which was nice but I still feel like I had solved the problem because Matt wanted to

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
know why Verizon hadn't wanted to give him five years in the first place and nobody had spoken to really

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:06.000
understood it all it really only Vera's English. Explain this.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
So trying to get fries on the

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
phone really felt a little bit like trying to get signed up for violence. It was difficult

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
but I could never really tell it was hard because they didn't want to talk or they wanted to but they

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
were messing up somehow or if I was just doing everything wrong. I emailed

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
their P.R. department asking how bad fires problem and they said they'd look into

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
it they gave me a call I missed their call but then when I tried to call the

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
next day the guy who I

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
had spoken to was on vacation and he said I was opposed to this other guy

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
or actually maybe this third guy but neither of those two guys got back to

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
me days one by e-mail when I answered and I could tell they were like

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
an opaque organization that was just pretending to be transparent or they were really trying and our

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
signals got crossing. So finally Sunday night I got frustrated as an email

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
that said I've got a union side and I just want to make sure that I also

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
had theirs and I got back to me.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
So we can you tell me what is your what's your title advice

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
and I mean you just have a Verizon spokesperson. So I mean I had all my guy

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
handled media relations for all of like you know like the New York Region stuff.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
This is Ray McConville we ended up talking for over an hour he was exceedingly

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
patient when the first things they ran by him. Was this theory that Verizon had stop supporting virus

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
because of an internal regime change. He did not confirm this theory.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Now that's just that's just nonsense. It is there's really nothing more I

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
can say that it has just started nonsense.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
So Ray would not say that Verizon had screwed up at any point according to Ray at this

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
point rise in really and truly has wired every neighborhood in New York City.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
He says in neighborhoods that have outside telephone poles. There's a aerial cabling and

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
where there's not outside telephone poles. There's underground conduits that can run the cables underneath the

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
ground and Ray denies that risin ever fell behind the schedule that they agreed

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
to you know as. The way we've been saying it is that we you know the requirements up by

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
twenty fourteen that you know we pass all the homes with with a network which which we've

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
done that part the next challenge with that is then getting it

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
directly into each and every property which is what we're dealing with right

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
now right I mean that was Can we talk about the

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
word pass.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
I mean if you want to say that a this is not a that's not going to be the most

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
exciting discussion but sure.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Well for me of was because that was the part where I

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
felt I feel like there are a lot of parts is that frankly over my head like I'm not a what do

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
you what do you what are you suggesting then I mean it seems like years ago jesting that where I'm

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
not sure what it is that you're getting at here that you're sort of acutely you you sound like you want to make

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
some sort of accusation and here I'm not sure what that is yet but

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
I know I don't want to make an accusation I just want to understand the reason the

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
reason I bring up passes because when I was watching the hearing there was an argument about what

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
that word meant and it feels like that word is actually really important in this

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
because it felt like the people the city the people who represent the

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
city were saying when you say you pass a wire outside a house like I think they pictured it very literally

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
like

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
they pictured Yeah well like I said I mean it's it runs every exit it

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
runs past every building but again like I said that that final challenge is we

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
now have to get it inside the actual

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
home now. I think that when Ray used the word passed he still using for eyes and definition the

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
word which is different from most people's Verisign seven ition I think is that if

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
the cable goes past your house. I mean it goes within walking distance of your

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
house. Raising don't get so caught up on whether or not you can see the cable hanging

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
outside your window. That's not the

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
point it doesn't have to be on the actual street but it's close enough to it such

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
that once we get permission we can bring it in like if you live in a suburban environment there may not

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
be you know a you know a telephone wire that runs down that exact street. Live close

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
enough to the closest poll that when you want service from us it's easy for us to come in and extend it to

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
you so it's the same situation in the urban environment.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
It's just that the difference there is we have today and get permission and work out an arrangement

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
with the property owner to come in and do the actual construction and that. You know that doesn't always

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
go

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
smoothly the property

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
owner Ray says that the landlords are the

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
issue that's that's the only remaining hurdle it's not. It's not that

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
if if you're if the landlord is begging us to come in and and

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
we say we start we can't do it we just don't have fiber facilities near your your apartment know that

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
that would be a case of a property that we don't pass the files but that's not the case

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
like we pass it because all that's left is you know to get that

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
we know that was that last however many feet it is to get it from the street into

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
the actual building.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Got it and that's true of every home in New York City at this point.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Pretty much yeah. What I mean pretty much over him yes the height of the

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
speaking so at this point I was feeling very

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
skeptical because we'd started out. This whole thing talking about landlords they said that mass landlord was

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
the problem and that turned out not to be true but what Ray was saying was a little bit more complicated

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
than that and he said the best way to explain it was to look at a part of the city where landlords actually are

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
not a problem.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
You know what you're in a suburban environment. You know only you know only two parties need to agree you know that a

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
guy who lives in the house and then and then us and we say OK here we come like Staten Island it's almost you

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
know pretty much close pretty close to one hundred percent availability as that now it's the

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
most

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
suburban borough. That's where I'm from my parents still live there they have it.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
It's you know there are certain parts of the Bronx MacQueen clean in Brooklyn that

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
are you know less urban you know where you see more traditional single

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
family homes when a customer called and said hey I want files we say sure we show

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
up climb up the pole we run a fiber drop from the nearest. All down to their

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
house and get it connected and that's

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
it whereas Manhattan says right. Manhattan still has problems with I have been a tradition.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Ray who is a Verizon spokesperson still can't actually get Fi OS in his own Hell's

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Kitchen

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
apartment and he says that he has a Manhattan. There are neighborhoods where you just can't run cables

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
on telephone poles there's no telephone poles outside and you might have to string them from

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
apartment building to apartment building. So even if your landlord is fine with having fire hose you still might need

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
permission from the landlord of the guy next door.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Raised as he can get really complicated.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Which makes sense and already was talking about it all pretty convincing but then later.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Ray followed up with actual information about Matthew it turned out that risin had tried to get in

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
touch with Matt's landlord they sent him a

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
letter but it was addressed to strict when Frederick instead of Fred Strickland his name

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
and it had just been one letter in the mail it was definitely an attempt but as somebody who has

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
sometimes not paid my cable bill. I know that when a cable company really wants to get in touch with

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
you they find other methods.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
So

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
that's

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
what I got I decided to call map back. Tell him what I learned and he would he

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000
thought. Well. Hey Matt. Thanks.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
I told

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
everything and I was like Yeah sure I make sense I don't trust their eyes and I don't trust the city his

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
big question was just why were they so whole freakin opaque with

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
me I don't know if they can why they couldn't like stated

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000
directly like OK here's what helps us come to a neighborhood to like you know make this happen.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
I mean maybe there's political reasons or whatnot but

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
I have answers for you if you want the answers Oh yes

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
of course I do. OK

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
so I asked I asked the guy drives and I was like you know a lot of

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
people are upset with you not because they know that they're legally and how the file is but because you

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
guys advertises a lot. He put it on all your trucks and drive it around and if you would just

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
like target your advertising or be better about communicating with people say if you

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
said like listen Crown Heights. You're not going to get Fios anytime soon or you said

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
like listen Bed Stuy you're in get files in two months like I think people would feel

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000
better and if so I think one reason they're not doing it is because if they said

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
that they're not like they're legally supposed to be doing this anyway so if they were like We're not doing it

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
they could get in trouble but but more interestingly the guy said to me he was like

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
listen this is really competitive like we we are kind of in this invisible

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
war with Time Warner Cable kept saying our competitors but in New York it's Time Warner and I

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
think optimum he's like we're in this war with them and if they knew that we were about to go to

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
some neighborhood but we hadn't gone

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
yet they could run in and they could call all their existing customers they call you and they'd

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:52.000
say

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
like oh yeah yeah yeah you know like why don't we give you a twenty dollar discount and you just sign

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
a two year exclusivity contract with us.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Yeah yeah yeah yeah go ahead. That is like

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
the story. Well that is exactly why consumers want to Sion

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
people providing the service don't want it at all and you know ultimately the thing that and

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
rages. Weirdly enough I was

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
once on a very brief date with someone who worked for Time Warner

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Cable and like I couldn't help but just be like sort of what's it like working

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
for such a despise company like well we're not just pies like

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
everyone loves us we have such a successful truck just sitting there thinking

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
like

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
that's so then I told Matt about how Patricia the other person who had been trying to get

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Vios she had actually had success she's getting it this week and it seems like

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
in general the people have the most luck are the people who have banded together who've gotten everybody

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000
on their block to agree that they want fire. Everybody lined up. Everybody wants it is that encouraging or discouraging.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
I do. That's definitely encouraging I mean that kind of puts me in a

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
position where like I could do something to help make this happen.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Can you see yourself I mean you have a four month old son but you also like to have fires could use years of doing that.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
So the thing is like I've got a son but I

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
also get way too much pleasure out of getting fixated on things

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
like this and you know to push things forward which is why I'm talking to you right

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
now and.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
The next thing that this become back which is you know me me stuffing like flyers and

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
mailboxes around my block

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
and you could see yourself doing that. Oh yeah no I mean I'm sitting next

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:54.000
to a printer like this could have been the stone.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.000
It

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
was do you feel like you feel like your ticket has been resolved.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Oh yeah like this this goes well beyond anything I was expecting to

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000
get out of when I submitted it. I was thinking like this might be just

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
like way to come polluted for the essence like the interest and then I guess I

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:20.000

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
our cable connection comes into the

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
building because it definitely comes in the front of our building which is more

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
like telephones.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
