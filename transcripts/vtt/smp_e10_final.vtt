ever since we have started sampler I wanted to have you on the show.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I mean I'm a super fan of your shop and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
specifically because I think that you are like one of my favorite interviewers of all time.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Thank you and like to say that the show is about the big questions and hard

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
choices that are often left out of polite conversation. So you can see why we

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
had the not suitable for

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
children but you managed to talk about.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Things as heavy as death and sex and money

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
without ever having it be like. Audrey or sensationalistic I mean

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
just like the money is like like

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that's ninety percent of the covers. Yeah actually I mean which

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I love. Which I absolutely love. But your show never ever feels

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
in there feels like you're Goc ing it feels like you're gently probing with Sometimes the questions that you

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
ask her like you're not

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
shy a lot of contradictions

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
very So today in honor of your show and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I we are going to play you that clip sex clip and a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
money clip but not the welfare Lee and that order. It's going to be even more surprising than I might think it's a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
money clip and it's really about death. Yes but our first script that we're going to

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
play is actually

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
from your show just to give listeners an idea of the kinds of

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
conversations that you

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
have it's from your interview with sex columnist Dan Savage

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
now he'll have this interview. Dan is the host of a pod cast called

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
the Savage Love cast in this clip and on the show you guys talked

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
about monogamy. He was saying that monogamy is

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
not necessarily a requirement for a relationship or

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
even beneficial to a relationship and then after he asserts this point you do something

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
really interesting something I never heard you do before

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
you asked him if there was anything he wanted to

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
know about

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
you Are you in a committed relationship. I am. Are you not monogamous.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Now we are monogamous Yes So what would you do if you found out that he cheated again what do you think he

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
would do if you found out that you cheated and cheating is something that will probably happen just put that out

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.000
there

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
first the research of the data shows that roughly fifty percent of men fifty percent of women in long

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
term relationships at some point will cheat and those fifty percent of men are not married

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
to those fifty percent of women so it will touch almost all committed monogamous relationship

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
so what's going to be your reaction if and when that happens to

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
you I know I mean I read. I read you Dan Savage and you make me uncomfortable because

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I intellectually I understand all this I get desire I get that it's not

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
rational and I get that it's it's a real

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
thing but it. I don't know what I would do with the hurt.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I have a really difficult time seeing a way outside

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
of it being OK. Being away for it to be OK.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
My advice would be if and when it happens. You know what people always say when

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
you know when they talk about the people they love most in their lives.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I would you know I would take a bullet for this person I would you know walk through fire for this

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
person that's hurt. You're saying I would hurt for this person in a really

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
profound and life threatening way I would take a bullet I would walk through fire.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Infidelity. When people believe in monogamy monogamy is what they want infidelity is

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.000
that

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
bullet and so if you look at your husband and think I could take a bullet for

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
that we're not married yet I am already Irving. If you want your partner and think this is someone you know I

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
love you so much I could take a bullet for

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
you just if and when it happens remember that feeling because that's the moment where you

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
take the bullet and some people accusing some pro you know not

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
monogamy that I'm you know giving get out of jail free cards to serial

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
adulterers and I'm not people should honor the commitments that they make if you make a

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
monogamous commitment you should attempt to keep it attempt to honor it do your

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
best and then if you. You know if it happens to you if you get cheated on.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
You know what is love and what is forgiveness if you can't forgive the person you claim to love most in the

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
world for betrayal that really cuts you to the core. I think these things should be because

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.000
infidelity is so

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
common these things should be thought about well in advance of them happening so I think if you just set your mind

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
to that as something as painful as that we can get through love each other through forgive

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
each other for your likelier to actually get through it love each other through and forgive each other for it when

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
it happens. If that happens.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Dan Savage thank you so much for your time. My pleasure.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
But that's all I'm going to say I'm not the same more about about whether it's a good

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
example of my boyfriend or if you're going to leave it

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
there were a few cheat on him or if I cheat on him through women

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.000
she

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
to

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
an extent comfortable all over again it makes rencounter Oh yeah. How did you

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.000
feel in that

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
moment. I know because I've heard Dan Savage talk a

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
lot about the importance of of exploring and being honest about monogamy

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and its constraints in relationships

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and and like I said to him you know you get it when you're thinking about it from

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
an intellectual level and then when when the conversation became like what would happen in

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
your relationship should one of you

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
cheat like it just becomes that much more raw to experience

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
that conversation when you're actually thinking about it in those terms of if there is a

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
betrayal or a violation. You know that we have to

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
encounter you guys even got on that topic. Only because you asked

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
him Do you have anything you know that you want to ask me Is there anything that you want to know about me why

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
would you do that that's that's like my greatest fear is like being interviewed it's kind of terrifying.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
It's something I ask people a lot now at the end of interviews that was the first time I had asked

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
it and thinking

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
back. It makes a lot of sense that it was to ask Dan Savage that because his job

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
is to you know give advice to people so he's always quickly assessing the

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
dynamics of you know what's going on in the person's life that he's engaging with so and

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
also he has his things that he are his core messages so

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
he is in some ways you know we're first on some things so and I knew

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
that asking him that would sort of throw it off through up through all of our conversation and it

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
would get to an interesting moment and it really did.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And of course Dan Savage is going to ask me one question it's like what's the deal in your

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
bedroom but. I

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
didn't somehow. And so but I I just

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
people got we got so many e-mails after that moment on the show because

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.000
to think

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
about whether cheating in a relationship is taking a bullet for your partner being willing

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
to love your partner through that betrayal is a good way to think of it or not people

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
have you know varying opinions but it. I think just to hear someone

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
openly acknowledge

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
that people get cheated on and people cheat was refreshing or

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
you think refreshing because when you're cheated on or when you're cheating.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
It's completely isolating because there's so much

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
shame and we did a episode last

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
year that was around that we just asked people to tell us their cheating story who are and that

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
was it was like you know you just sort of opened the can and

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
people wanted to needed to share because think about it if

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
your partner of multiple years who everyone knows you as a couple and

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and then you find out that that he or she is having a you know tawdry

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
affair on the side. It's humiliating Yeah I'm going to tell talk about that. But there's

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
so much you have to process and that you feel alone and I

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
think that's what I that's what I really like about pod cast is like

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
in particular what I was trying to do with that sex and money is that it can be a place where you can like

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.000
let

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
yourself access those emotions and you don't have you know it's such an intimate setting

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
that it gives you a little bit of space that wasn't there before to to maybe process some

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
of that stuff.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Sarge had to raise my eyebrows

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000
but that was. I guess this is why you're able to say all this is why you host.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
the resistor next clip. It's either a death clip effects clip or money clip or this.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Service for a pod cast called first time last time so it's created by this guy band and

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
air and it's all about people talking about the first time that they did something and the last time that they

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.000
did the same

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
thing in this episode an author named Joe lawyer is talking about a big decision

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
that he made moving from life as a petty criminal act to something much

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
much

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
grander I was committed to the idea that I was a new man and

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
new life. Fuck I'm going to go rob a bank.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So I drive up to United States and I go to downtown San Diego

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and I start walking in Outer Banks and I walk to the first bank at ten o'clock in the morning.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I stand there and I grab my deposit slip and on the back of

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
it with a marker I write.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
We have a bomb. I have a gun and the money now

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and as I finish writing it I look up and I panic and I walk out.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Turns out for the rest of the day I walk in and out of bags and I'm leaving in various stages

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
of distress. I stand in line producer actor in the leave. I go to the front allied sir you're

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
next I'd leave. I was like how to walk to and I would get a hint that there was

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
a guard around theirs and then I'd

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
leave and so at four forty five o'clock.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I can't go. I don't do good today. I'm a lame I'll never rob a bank if

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I want to be a bag over here it is and you got

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
to fucking shit or get out the pot and it's four forty five it's deadline

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000

she she probably got second one word and you know she's really taking the time to read this.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Now she could read it twice. Hey we know she is fucking a machine I lived in overhead.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So I like. And I lean forward I'm fucking around and I can like move the notes

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000

her and I'm like fuck do you mean my

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
no back my side back she pulled back you know we're doing a tug of war with the fucking no one is you still refuse to look

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
up and she just she lifts her head of looks to me and starts handing me

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
money and assuming the door bomb

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I start

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
running when I was that age I was thin

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and lean as fast as fuck broke school records and track. So I hit the

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
streets

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
running faster sparks and I look bad there I mean chase down people in

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
the Bangor Jays meet like they're after me and I'm just making sure you know I'm just making space

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
between us I get over to a cab a couple blocks away I jump

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
in a small excited

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:01.000
fucking forty three hundred bucks for nothing. Basically the work itself less than ten minutes.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Rob me of stealing cars like Bones Charlie I know I'm

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
going to be. I'm not going to be petty I'm now going to be a bank robber.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Can you guess the kind of thought that

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
was I think

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
the money when I think you're right and my favorite is if I don't do this today I'm never going to be

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
a bank

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
robber

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
go time exactly like me are nothing it's all or

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
nothing but actually speaking of money. It's like the money that you specifically talk

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
about on your show so I think that

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
like death and sex are topics that people regularly know how to like engage with up to

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
a certain point and kind to think and there are also topics that I think that people

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
find more on avoidable. I find the money conversations actually on your

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
show to be the most surprising. Why

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
do you think it is that people are so weird about money are so hell.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
The tent to talk about it I guess like in in plain life or say yeah in life in

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
general it's like

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
people talk about sex with their partners they'll talk about death with their family members or with their

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
children but people will not talk about money with

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
anyone sometimes.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Yeah I think it starts with We don't really know how because there's not a common language.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
You know about sex if you share a peer group with people you know you kind of can assume that you

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
know there's certain values that you share the like things like you know consensual sex is

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
important you know desire

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
is is something that both women and men have you know but around money it's

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
like we talk about it so little that we don't have any like there's no

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
prompts really and I think it's from a few things like first like

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
you never know where you stand with the person you're talking with.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
You could have much more money and be much more comfortable in the world as a result and

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
not have that existential dread that you're not safe in the world

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
that can happen when you don't feel like you have enough

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
money you might have shame about having money so I think that

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
that that's like the baseline and then I just. I think it's so interesting

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and to have a conversation where you're

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
like acknowledging that there. There's something deeper about those choices

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
than just like trying to follow you know Susie or men's. Perhaps

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
finance advice you know. I think is interesting because there is there's a lot

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
of decisions we

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
make about what we think about how our life is going to go. Yeah you can get to when you ask

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
about money.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Yeah. Money's emotional that's something I'm finding the older that I get is that like money is

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
extremely emotional. And it's like emotional and

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
it's also like it's also so black and white and cut

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
and dry it's like there is this amount of money in my checking account right

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
now but I have so many feelings about it. The way I feel about it today is different

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
than I felt last night in the middle of the night when I was worrying about X. or Y. You know I find that kind

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
of interesting.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
I'm glad you asked about it and gradually enjoyed our money clip yeah it's good really

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
good so we're going to actually take a quick break right now but

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000

garden vegetable and mangled why fusions are made with the same perfectly right. Hostile

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000

I obsess over has to be handled with care.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
I go through there myself I walk a mile if you're a dick. You can imagine right I'm Mexican and

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
I grew all being under very welcome

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000

had the perfect recipe for these veggie fusion or a

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
family that they have that feeling is that the two cops function very good in your hands

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
because they did we look at each other like we were talking with that. And that dirty smile and there

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
was like yes yes

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
like falling in love at first sight. It was just a really happened I don't think with

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000

death sex and money and in. Our And our clubs

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
of her show. So we've already gotten the money out of the way we've done the

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
hard thing. So into this next clip is actually from

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
something that you've recommended. So we asked you to send us back your steps

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
they're into and helps us inform what clips we think might be good for you to hear.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
So you brought us an episode from Fresh Air with Terry Gross which is an N.P.R.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
interview show and also a pod

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
cast this interview is with Tim Gunn who is best known for his role as a

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
mentor on Project Runway. What was it about this interview that you enjoyed so

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
much I can remember exactly where I was listening to it I was on the subway the

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
way it started was very charming like Terry who doesn't

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
make interviews about her they started by exchanging information about what

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
they were each wearing because they were in the same the audio just

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
like you know her first question what are you wearing and he was wearing something very you

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
know classic and put together and then she described

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
her outfit and they talked about pleather versus the in leather I just was very

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
I just really liked it I liked that it was

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
like it was a surprising open end and

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
then very quickly it became a conversation

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
about who Tim Gunn was before he was Tim Gunn on television

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
including his his really severe depression when he

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
was a teenager.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And then it became a conversation about how he how he

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
felt like he got well and he talked really lovingly about his macho

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
dad his dad who was a

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
speechwriter for J. Edgar Hoover like just the so much interesting

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
stuff packed in but it was all about basically ten done learning

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
how he wasn't alone in the world.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
We. Have chosen a clip from that episode is Terry Gross ask Tim

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Gunn about how he attempted suicide nature which he had talked about in

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
a get better You Tube video. So he starts off by explaining

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
to Terry what tipped him over the edge.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I had been dropped off at yet another boarding

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
school by my parents and it was that first night I had taken.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
I don't even know how

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
many prescription medications out of my

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
parents' medicine chest and I didn't even know what they were I mean I knew there were prescription but

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
I didn't know what they were and I took all of them probably easily one hundred

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
pills

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
and I was so resigned to just going to sleep

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:47.000
and not waking

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
up and that next morning I did wake up and I

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
was completely disoriented the room was spinning. I couldn't believe I was

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
still alive

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
and my disorientation didn't get

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
better so I went to the school administrators and told them what I had done and then of course they brought by brought on

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
a doctor and despite the fact that I was still they are they took my blood pump

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
my stomach there was still stuff in it. Anyway it's a long winded way of saying yes there

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
was a catalyst it was

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
that I was being dropped off at another school had no reason to believe that that experience was going to be any

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
better than anything else that I had gone through and I thought I don't like this life this

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
is this is really

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
rotten and I want to just stop it.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
So my father took me to the hospital and what

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
I didn't expect was that I'd spend the next two and a half years

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
there were in the hospital. Yes I have and I

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.000
don't know that I've said that to anyone. Well I mean more precisely two years and four months.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
So I had a very major intervention there and couldn't run

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
away or I would have. Was that considered like rehab.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Was on a rehab I don't even know what it was it was a psychiatric hospital

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
for adolescents. Was it the right thing to do you think to yes.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
It saved my life and the doctor I had

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
there and he was actually my third doctor because I was a very

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
difficult patients and doctors would I want to give up on

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
me but they'd pass after about three months and Dr Phillip Goldblatt

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
God bless him wouldn't let go I saw him five days a week

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
for almost two years. What made doctors

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
give up on you before that do you think. They would they would lose patience.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
I mean I will say this about myself I'm

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
smart and I'm canny I think things out

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
quickly and I knew how to manipulate a maneuver

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
around them and I knew how to simply be intractable and

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000
difficult and for Dr Goldblatt I mean our first couple months together.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
He was with me. Almost all day every day and it was a matter

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
of guess what

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
you can't escape me and if you want to keep playing these games.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000
I'm here to say OK play them I'm just I'm going to watch it all happen but I'm not leaving.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
And I didn't believe him and I tried to push all those buttons so that he

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
would reject me and he wouldn't stand for it and I love that man.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000
If that's cheer up when I think about him and what he did for me. Do you think about him when you're mentoring people.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:39.000
I

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
do you mention that you like this interview because it was learning about

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
this public figure because the journey. He went on to feel like he wasn't alone in the world as he put

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
it and he had talked about the suicide story

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
before but that particular detail the hospitalization. He

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
had mentioned before he talked to Terry Gross and I. I find that when I listen to your show that people

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
have the same. The same sorts of reactions like the same sorts

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
of you know like I didn't know that I was going to say this or I don't know if I talk about this or people get choked up

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
or people pause or what do you think it is like what do you think happens in the

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
guest's mind or what do you think is happening with Augusta motion and it gets to

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
get that gets them to the point where they share something that they

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
genuinely haven't

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
before said that clip that you just played with Harry how she asked the

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
question after learning that it was more than two years and. In a mental hospital she said do you think that

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
was the right thing to do like it was such a gentle way to say

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
how do you feel about that time do you feel like you were you know locked up.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Do you feel like you needed it and you feel resentful do you feel.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Glad and it. It's that kind of question that then he gets to say

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
here's how I feel about my life and you can tell she's really listening

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
and so I think that there's something around.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
There's just something that happens when you feel like you're being really listened to and when someone really wants

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
to not only sort of understand exactly what you're saying but

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
like understand the details of that moment like well. Where were you

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
living how old were you what was going on and so then they start. They kind of go back to

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
that to that moment they start nearing it in a way that that brings in more details than

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
maybe what if they told the same story at a dinner party.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
But I think it begins and ends with that feeling of surprise

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
that someone is actually listening carefully to

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
you off on your show people tell you these really surprising stories even

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
like even when it seems like you've probably done some pretty interviewing obviously to find out certain details to know

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
kind of what to move

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
toward still you actually get in the conversation and they say something about obviously

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
surprises them if they've told you but also sometimes you seem surprised. What's the

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
most surprising thing. Not necessarily show. But what's the most

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
surprising thing that Augustus told

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
you one of the thing the mediately comes to mind because it's one of

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
my favorite moments on the show because I did not know

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
I didn't know this is where we were going but I was talking to

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Dominic Foxworth who is with all the former yes I'm all former N.F.L.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
player now a graduate of Harvard Business School I was asking about the dynamic

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
on campus when

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
you're eighteen thousand French men you're you're already kind of a star on campus

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
when you show up right out of high school because you're a college football player at a at a big

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
college football

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
school. And I asked him what it was like with

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
women thinking it would be like yeah you know here's a story you know because you

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
you sort of you know you kind of know what that experience but I don't often hear narrated.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
And he brought in this dimension to the conversation that I hadn't really thought about and he

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:56.000
was

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
like you know yeah I mean you know I treated women not as well as I would now as I'm

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
a little older but then he went on to describe the racial dynamic on campus at University

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
of Maryland where it's a majority white

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
school women who would necessarily be interested in you as kind of a long

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
term relationship type of person that I well this big kind of like mending go

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
strong black man let's experiment with that and see what this is all

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000
about what I'm really aware that at the time or looking

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
back I think

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
I was aware of it at the time or I kind of I think I used it

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
to justify some of the things

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
that that I would do you know so I wasn't like

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
be the best boyfriend or the best everything at the time

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
and I think I would use things like that like well they're just after me because they just want

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
to be a close.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
To the football guy or they just think that I'm in great shape and I'm like this they're a typical

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
like over sex a black male and they want to give that. Try but they don't actually

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
want to take me seriously

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
so I mean whatever I don't care if like I am with her

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
and her friends don't read much about it you know so I think I was aware of it to

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000
the extent that it gave me cover.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
I remember that I was I remember I was on a flight to San Francisco in like

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
I think it was June of last year when I like went back and listened to that episode.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
I remember where I was when he answered your

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
question. With interest. Oh my gosh I mean it's like because it's like of course that's a

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
dynamic that's happening but you don't I just had never heard

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
someone say it out loud and maybe that's because I'm a white person and you

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
know black men aren't often talk to me

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
about their love life but but I think that that just

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
like it made it just me like you know it's easy to say

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
like oh these you know athletes and rock stars and whomever are you know treating all

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
these women like garbage because they can but to see

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
how the other side of that and the emotional dimension of feeling like you yourself

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
are being used for whatever reason because you're star power because you're you

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
know you know in shape black men in college girls

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
are just trying to be with you and I just thought it was like this

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
really complicated. Dynamic and it was it was a it was

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
an answer that I wasn't expecting and I just loved love that moment.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Obviously I'm black or in this I date black men and that answer surprised me I

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
had never heard anybody like it something that I knew but it's not anything that I ever

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
heard anybody put into words and then share and I guess went on with called mixed company.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
So I was yeah you know.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
I was not I did not see that what I know I mean for me it's made watching college sports so much

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
more interesting. You know what is happening all of your life. You know if I get out

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
of jail and being a sideline reporter like the questions I would ask.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
So yes so we've had our money clip.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
We've had our death clip and so

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
now we've arrived and waiting for even waiting around or is there a crowd

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
pleaser the sex clip. So this

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
crew comes to us from actually a sister show of yours another W. and I see pod

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
cast called. Only Human. OK which is hosted by Mary Harris and in this episode

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
she interviews. Max Rich who is twenty four year old writer from New York and when

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
he was a teenager he was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
cancer. He had to get chemotherapy but before he could start treatment he had to take

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
some

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
precautions cancer makes you sterile right as comfortable as my

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
cancer chemo. You know makes you sterile sorry. It's all one in the same

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
as just one of one of the tails and one of the heads. So we decided to

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
set some of my sperm aside. So my wife can now. Realistically talk about babies with me was

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:05.000
a good

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
decision but the harvest station of the sperm was very

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:16.000
fraught because you know I'm sitting there in the hospital room.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
And my mom calls the sperm bank for me she gets all the

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
equipment gives me a tube and she looks at me and she says you got to do

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
this and then like I guess call me when you're done. I'll be waiting outside.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
So she steps outside. What are you thinking at this. I'm thinking this is the fucking weirdest

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
thing that's ever happened to anyone.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
I'm right now binding one of the most humiliating and strange

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
moments with my child's D.N.A. was like what eventually will be

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
calling me dad and like whenever I look in his kids' eyes. I'm going to be remembering like

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
the creaking sound of my hospital bed. You know that I'm making matching with the

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
beeping of my opium drip you know is a very weird.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Every teenage boy has some story about a time when usually it was their

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
own impulse to masturbate led them into a weird situation.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
This was completely stunned upon me by the world and it was very very

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
strange so and then I end up producing.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
And I go

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000
mom and mom is waiting outside and I hear her you know she's Israeli and she has a bit of

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
an accent which I can't do properly but I think captures are stalled. So my mom walks

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
in takes my sperm and she sticks it into or a little like lipstick

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
pant pocket like this really hip little lipstick pocket she

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
has and she goes I was the first one to hold my grandchildren

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
before even their

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
mother. And look at that mother considering the sperm the whole

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000
child.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000
So that you had in mind when we said we had a Thanksgiving. Now what

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
I love that I love that because I you know you

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
think he's going to be like talking about just how odd it is to just you know the

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
sperm but the process. That he goes the step the step further of thinking about that

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
when he looks in his child's eyes this is where it all began like

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
that

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
yeah I like that like even though it's really I mean has to be fashioning

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
credibly scary and tragic time as a

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
parent to see this person who you have raised to you've

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
created and who you know you assume and you

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
also really hope is going to outlive you by a lot right to see

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
them going through this really devastating time but to still like find all

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
of these ways to support and all of these ways to just

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
be funny and bring like levity to a situation. That's like only your family can

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
find a way to find a gentle somehow appropriate way to

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
humiliate you while you're like right before you start to kind of talk you know.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.000
I love

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
that the sort of only human. I really love that.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
And I have one last question for you is there anything that you would like

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
to know about me you half god I should

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
have seen this coming. Brittany.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
OK I'm ask you a money question. Oh my God But it's I'm just curious so it

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
seems to my impression of your life at this moment you've had like

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
a major not only like did you make a major career shift you did it in a very public

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
way where like you

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
haven't you have an audience and feel kind of exposure maybe exposed as

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
you're like learning how to be the host of sampler and what sampler is absolutely. I

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.000
understand the dynamics Yes but what's it been like to.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
As you think about. Let's see what some of the money angle I want to know about is

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
like you had a you had a more conventional career path before

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
you came together. Do you find yourself do you

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000
feel more secure financially now.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Or did you feel more secure then and like how do you weigh that against

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
the like what it feels like now to have your creative work here. The

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
way you're making money.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
I feel more financially secure

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
now because I mean to be honest I make more money now than I did at

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:30.000
my previous

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
job see radio pay but also

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
I have a lot more sponsibility The thing is though it's like the like the actual amount of

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
money is not something that I think is much about. I think a lot more

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
about. I guess like so much of

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
like so much of my livelihood before depended upon

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
an organization like there are so many other people who are responsible for the

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
product like the end product has very little to do with me. Had very little to do with me whereas

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
now the end product of everything that I make has a lot to do with me and

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
I feel. I feel a lot of pressure

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
now that I feel a lot of pressure to

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
consistently deliver on myself which is not something that I really had

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
a concept of before and not something that I ever set out to make my living

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:30.000
on and to constantly be figuring out the best.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
For Jand of that that I can that I can give to people so it's weird because my money now

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
depends on.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Me in this way in this way that doesn't like not to say that I have a fantastic

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
team like I have so much support. Gimlet It's not that it's more so

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
like people interact with a what is essentially a product that

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
has my face and name on it and then let your voice.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Yeah mostly my voice exactly. But like that's weird which is actually in my voice which is scarier

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
like everything that I say like that's that's that still feels very ephemeral to me even though

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
I know it's not I work with people who have had long careers during exactly

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000
this but like I had been doing other type of other types of work

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
consistently for what for me felt like a long time so to then like do something completely

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
different and that part feels actually scary and that part sometimes wakes me up in the middle the night.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
But then you can just roll over and

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
remember that I just got her

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
hey I will say my sheets are nicer

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
now yes good investment.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
God you how did you do that I just saw you ask me a question and then

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:40.000
I

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
just started like waxing for minutes about like how I feel about I always feel

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
emotionally about the amount of money I make and where my livelihood comes

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
