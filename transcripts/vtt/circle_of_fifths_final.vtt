00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Adam. Where have you

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
been I joined the Air Force and it did

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
not go well terrible inner ear issues afraid of heights.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
No I did not join the Air Force. I actually was promoting The Big

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Short but I am happy to be back. Surprisingly awesome with you Rachel.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Adam Davidson our whole amazing team. I feel like I should give you the honors you should introduce our guest.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Our guest actually is from The Big Short He's our composer Nicholas

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Britto was a concert pianist a degree in psychology from

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Harvard who has also done music for twelve Years a Slave gimme the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
loot and he wrote

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
this.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
From gimlet media. This is surprisingly awesome. I'm Rachel

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Ward and I am Adam McKay And joining us is Nick Britell

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I am incredibly honored to be

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
here

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and if we brought you here to help us understand this

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
very specific idea from music very new proposes a topic of

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
our episode because this concept is everywhere. It's a tool that composers

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
are always using because it evokes a very specific set of emotions in us and it can

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.000
help us

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
understand what exactly it is that you do for a living. It's called

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The Circle

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:35.000
event

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
of the circle of fifths for me is this incredibly it's a very beautiful

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
core progression and hopefully by the end of the episode. It will be clear what it is how

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
it feels when you hear

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
it and also I think it's a cool lens through which we can understand a lot

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
of issues around music theory like starting with things like pitch and intervals and

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
chords and leading all the way through kind of how composers and songwriter.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Right music. So that's why the circle for this I think is pretty pretty amazing.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I actually had a horrible musical education. When I was in

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
school all I remember from my musical education was like

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Ta-Ta T.T. ta rest rest and then like all college kids I

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
learned like five chords on a guitar and aggravated future girlfriends by

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
playing horribly on it

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
so I I come to this world having been betrayed by it but

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm open minded we want to hear

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
a circle of fifths I think I think so we know what we're going for let's

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
hear the circle of death. OK here's a circle of

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
fifths Fly Me to them. Let me

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
play a monk

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
this let me see what spring

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.000
is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
like a do gooder and me. OK And it's also

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000
here.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
You only

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
get

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
in

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and apparently it is also here.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
while I understand that we heard a circle at the end there. Yes I'm totally

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
incapable of identifying it that's OK That's OK so in order to understand this concept we're going to

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I think we have to start at a very very basic

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
level

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
for me I think the most basic element to begin with is pitch. So I think by starting with an understanding like

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
what a note actually is we'll be able to sort of build up to the idea of

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
what what chords are and then eventually to what chord progressions

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
are can I confess something which is very embarrassing. Although I love music.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
All I know. Pitch from really being honest is Randy Jackson on American

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Idol tells people they're Pitchy all the time. Pitchy dogs dogs

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
it's awful job security concept that was a little pitchy dog. That's all I know pathetic.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I'm in there I'm forty

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
seven. Basically a pitch is

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
actually what your brain

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
perceives when it when it hears a

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
repeated vibration. That's regular in nature which is so I'll unpack that a little bit.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
There are lots of things in nature that repeat. But repeat kind of slowly.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So let's imagine a propeller of an airplane for

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
a second or a natural phenomenon like a propeller on an airplane. So when you imagine

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
a propeller when it first starts up. It's

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
repeating not very quickly.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
it sounds kind of like this you know mechanical whooshing

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
sound but what's interesting then I think everyone will recognize this happening

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
when you hear a propeller start spinning very quickly. You know as a plane might

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
be starting to take off. You haven't noticed that the sound of that starts changing and you start

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
hearing false with sounds like a drone

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:28.000
know

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
what the see there's starts to be like a drone note in there that you hear that doesn't sound the candle

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
it actually starts to sound like a sort of weird note and what's happening is that

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
basically once something starts repeating at a certain level

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
of speed. Your ear and your brain start perceiving this as a

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
note that if rhythm repeats rapid enough succession. Eventually it becomes a

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
note the threshold of of where we start hearing pitches usually around twenty hertz which is

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Hertz is a unit inside. And that has to do with

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
frequency so how many times something happens how many cycles something happens per second. So twenty hertz

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
is twenty cycles twenty somethings per

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
second and what's interesting too is actually that the brain may have

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
something funny about that area of frequency because for

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
example it's approximate that same area

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
where frames in in film start looking

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
like fluid motion as

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
well so that's fascinating so that twenty twenty vibrations per

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
second threshold Yes really interesting so it isn't just

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
that seems to be where our mind orders things and looks

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
for commonalities and

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
structure that's the point where our brain sort of just get tired

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
more likable I don't know what music exactly. Yeah exactly. So your brain just summarizes a

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
lot it's like so much information your brain's like Oh actually

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
that's out now so Hertz is a measure of how many

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
times per second something vibrates and when we're hearing pitch our brains are

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
processing those

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
vibrations they're converting them into a note and what that note is

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.000
depends

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
on how many vibrations. We're

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
hearing there's thousands of all these different frequencies there's all these different ways of making

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
sound so one of the interesting things is that different cultures

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
have different frequencies that they have chosen as being

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the ones that to some extent kind of matter to them for their music and

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
in Western music you know we have certain frequencies that we've kind of you know there's these

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
conventions we've agreed to we say OK this is that

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
frequency the most famous one is a which is defined

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
actually as four hundred forty Hertz zero four hundred forty vibrations of cycles a second.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
This is a so we choose this frequency and we say

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
hey four hundred forty Hertz that pitch is is a which actually I can.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Play right here. So as

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
this. That say the air molecules here when I hit this. Are

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
you know vibrating at four hundred forty and a second. So that's what you

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
hear right so as four hundred forty.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Yes vibrations per second yes. What if he's got like four hundred forty one.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Yep totally totally so that would be you know there's a

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
certain range around notes

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
where the brain basically feels it's still the

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
A and that would be a little bit what what in music would call sharp.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So things that are a little bit higher than a

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
set frequency we say they're a little

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
sharp and things that are a little under a frequency we said we call them a

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
little flat in other

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
words pitchy dog.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So what. How do octaves fit into this. So if you're at four hundred

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
forty vibrations per second with a. Like what happens when you jump up an

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
octave

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
what's going on so basically when you double a frequency. It's what we would

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
call an octave with the way just so it's that simple it's

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
that simple so basically if A is four hundred

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
forty when you double the frequency of that you say OK I'd want to double that frequency

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
on here eight hundred eighty you hear.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
OK to just be clear pretty much every human when they hear four hundred forty or

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
eight hundred eighty Hertz that frequency is going to sound like the same note. But what

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
they call it and what they consider a scale those those things

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
will vary across

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
cultures Exactly. OK so we understand pitch we understand the vibrations

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
relatively well. So now how are we. How are we bending towards this

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
magical circle of

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
fifths we're only doing one thing at a time exactly which is not how most

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
music sounds most music doesn't just do one of the time so the second no the second

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
note so we're going to start with the most basic one we already talked about to keep it simple

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
so what. If

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
we play the A and then we play the other

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
a one octave up at the same time. OK And Adam you already said that's an octave. So we

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
got an octave you're already playing what's called an interval.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
That's two notes at once that's an octave.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Sounds really consonant really stable and an interval could be any two notes I

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
mean the notes and you know if I could

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
play. You know I could play.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I could do any of these these are all intervals you know all these things are intervals

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and each interval is

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
related. It's just the ratio of these frequencies so this one we know is two to one.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So now what if we choose another radio yakitori it's that's today. So what you just played the octave

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
and octave two to one because because the frequency of this one is four hundred forty

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
her and the frequency of this

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
one hundred eighty her. So if you just take eight hundred eight by

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
foreigner forty

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
two doubled. I feel comfortable with that amount of totally that's that's as much as we will need. OK.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Just

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
double so and I'm just so let's keep it simple here.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
What if I'm just going through a number out there what if I said I want to increase the ratio here I

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
want to take this and I want to increase the frequency by fifty percent that's all I want to

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:23.000
do as want to say what does the note sound like if I increase this fifty percent.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So that's the ratio of eighty three to two and that's actually how you

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
define it. It's basically

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
fifty percent more frequency is a fifth we call it. This is that in the name

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
in music theory give is called a perfect fifth.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
So this feels like a lot of math for me to have to manage in

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
this setting but it sounds like what you're saying is that the relationships between the

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
notes in an interval that relationship can be summarized

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
mathematically and our brains tend to like it better. They like

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
the sound better with that math is actually pretty simple.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
In western music we've chosen certain very simple relationships

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
between frequencies and the fifth is this one so that's

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
a to see and that's an interval because it's to

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
douse two notes it's an interval certain types of intervals. You

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
know tend to feel certain degrees of stable

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
or

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
unstable and this is to some extent due to culture you know maybe the numbers are just

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000
easy for our brain to process relationships. So if I do this for a second.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I feel a little bit a little different right. I mean my response that was like that got darker

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
different the fifth is like

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
a reveal in a

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
movie like The Turns out the wife is alive. And

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
she steps in the door with the fifth the second one feels like she's not

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
alive and that guy's going to commit suicide. That's interesting you say that

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
because

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
the second one. This is

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
a very famous interval called the tri

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
tone and in fact in the Middle Ages. It was

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
referred to as Diablo lists in music which is the devil

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
in music this ratio and was forbidden false and was actually

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
forbidden to be used. You

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
know in certain contexts and it wasn't really until like around the seventeen hundreds

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that people started using it and the tried of the funny thing with the tragedy is that it's actually

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
not you know

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
it's on its own it sounds less Let's imagine less potentially

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
a stable than the faith. But when you use it in a context of other types of music.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
It's great and actually can be used in so many different ways so for example

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
just to show where the try tone is very clear the beginning of this theme song

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
as the Triton were almost right away.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.000
So

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
that's a track down the. Is that the tried to own in

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
the sixteen hundreds you would've gone to jail forever and every burned at the stake for

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
that that for the tribe down. So even in The Simpsons that we just heard you know it starts the tri tone but

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
right away goes to fast so

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
it's you know that right away it's actually And funny enough

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
to try to turn there is almost

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
like the step to getting to the perfect which is the resolution of that.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Let's call it dissonance you know which is similar in like Bernstein's Maria. You

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
know

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000
that

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
right there you go you have you have the dry tone and then it goes right

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
away you know.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Oh oh.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Annette

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
what would happen if you did a trike shown at the beginning of our national anthem. Like if

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
you added a try Joan that resolved with the fifth.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
What would it sound if we do it where it actually if we start out it would be something like

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:14.000
this

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
or over or O.B.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
this would be interesting

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
study Civil War

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
what happened forty years earlier you tell us there are a bunch of

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
these intervals these sequences of notes and they've all got these like funny names but the one that we're

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
really focusing on is the perfect fifth this one it's like this what is the building block

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
of what we're talking about today of the circle of fifths

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and from what I understand what makes a fit the fit is basically the relationship between the

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
notes in the inner Well basically in the scale. If we're thinking about like a piano they're

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
just five keys away from each other one two three four five perfect.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I like to think in a way if you think of like composing as sort of this you know like a

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
chef mixing all these different intervals and core. And rhythms and pitches together

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
different intervals to me have different almost like flavors. You know.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
So we're getting interval. Yes we're getting two notes at a time you know for the time so.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
So now it feels like we're on the threshold of chords right we

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
are right on the threshold of chords we are we are exactly there and

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.000
if

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
we Rachel there's no way I'm ready for this can we take a break I'm going

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
to go take a shower. Have a cup of tea.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Take a walk around the neighborhood and then we do

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
this I think that sounds

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
fair

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
this episode of surprisingly awesome is brought to you by Ford Motor Company where engineer

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
modern Hammoud live by the following words of wisdom.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
What would the fusion energy

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
do the fusion energy as Ford's plug in hybrid vehicle and when Martin started working on

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
these cars that are designed to help maximize driving. Efficiency. It changed the way

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
he lived his life outside of work. So what would the fusion energy do with the

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
heat generated during

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
breaking it's repurposing it and using it as electricity to propel the vehicle.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
So I started collecting the food that we would otherwise throw away and turning

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
it

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
into compost the fusion energy did not just inspire Mohsen to compost it

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
also completely changed his family's morning pancake routine W W

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
S E

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
T What with the fusion energy do when it came

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
to the trees on our property. We had some big maple trees and

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
we love bank X. we buy a lot of maple syrup to look at that

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
look for the future the energy do a block like tap into the trees and see if I can

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
collect some sap make my own maple syrup and I did it

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
before where engineering isn't just about driving better. It's about living

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
better go to ford dot com awesome to learn

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
more this episode is surprisingly awesome is brought to you by. Squarespace

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
the easiest way to build a beautiful website portfolio or online store.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
So we have the thought that we should create a square Space page just about Adam

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Davidson a love it. What should we put on

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
it I think we should call it. Adam Davidson big meaty head

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
and it should be a close up of Adam

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Davidson face across the full screen and then all the

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
entrances to the site are all like through David's right eye left eye

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
mouth and then you go to the other parts of the space. There are also super close ups

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
of Adam Davidson face.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
So the Web site it would be like endless Davidson. But I like that title too that's good

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
and it could be like one of those like really annoying old school websites where has like a song playing as soon as you

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
get there totally

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Davidson

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
and I'm back. I've just taken a shower. I've had some cameo P.C. I read a little bit

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
of Kilgour bronze the profits. I feel very centered. Let's do

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
it it's going to court.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
All right from gimlet media this is surprisingly often I'm Rachel

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Ward and I am at a McKay And we're joined by Nicholas Britto and

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
we're talking about the circle of

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
fifths and so we have been made to understand that a

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
note and pitch and a frequency are all pretty much the

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
same thing pretty much. So we're going to use all those words pretty interchangeable

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Absolutely. Another idea that's on the table here is the idea of an interval just two notes

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
played at the same time. Exactly and a type of interval

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
is a fifth

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
a fifth is a type of an interval Exactly so it's it's when you go from one note and

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
you go up. Five notes. So you

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
go if you're on the first first note here you can say. So this is if we define the first

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
one the second note is to going up the scale three or

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
four fifths that's how we

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
would counted in music theory. OK where do we go from here. OK So

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
we have these different types of intervals and interval again we're saying is basically.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Two notes at once so chords are when we

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
add more notes so it could be three or more notes you get chords before

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
that when you're dealing with intervals or just talking

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
like the sort of flavor of of intervals isn't quite as complex let's say as

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
the flavors that you can get when you have full chords. You know you can really cook all

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
this crazy stuff once you have these three no

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
chords. And just to make it very very clear when we talk about chords. We always talk about

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
the chord based on that first note. So that means that there's more than one a chord right.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
So and a chord is basically any notes you stack on top of an

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
A here. That's a

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
major a minor you could have a

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
dominant seventh.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
That was that was my and it came when I played basketball and college I was I was

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
a dominant seven I heard that that's yeah. Can you can both us some walk on music for him real

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
quick with using his nickname.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Ladies and gentlemen from the University of Kentucky our

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
forward dominance.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
MCCANN

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
That's your weirdest basketball nickname ever so you're saying a dominant seven years in

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
a minor you're saying. A

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
major is it always the note on the gold last of the cord is the

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:05.000
one defining

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
it absolutely the the for the lowest note generally is what we would call it. You

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
know the bass note on the chord the people have different terms for people called the bass

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
no people called the root. People call the fundamental all the different terminology basically when

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
you're when you're thinking about chords and harmony. The simplest most

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
most fundamental way of thinking about it is that it's the bass note that kind of determines a lot

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
of Western harmony and that's why when you think about

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
in you know in a band or the bassist is such a crucial all

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:37.000
crucial

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
thing because the bass is actually what's going to help you kind of know what chord you're on at any

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
given time. It's almost more B.S. than

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
B.S.S. it's a great way to think about and like a home play bass like the bassist the

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.000
basic Yeah

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
right so we're in the realm of chords is exactly. A

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
vague caveman like knowledge of chords

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
now is a chord progressions or just when you play. More than you know two or

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
more chords in a row you get a chord progression. Just like the sort of parade of

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
chords So for example there are these very famous and very often

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
used chord progressions in Western music. We were talking about

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
five one like the perfect fit you know going from

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
a five to

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
one. If you build the chords on top of the as

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
notes you then get that thing called the authentic and the five one progression

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
which is this so

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000
basically So here's five. And here's one.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
So you hear that

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
sound very common sound it feels very like

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
your and almost at like the ending of something you

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
like and are done. You know this

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.000
is

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
and then another one. Actually here's one called ball play this and you. You think

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
so we're very used to

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
this Bible on what if I

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
go

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
oh that's called deceptive. That's called deceptive. I

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
like that a set of current exegesis applications because your brain cannot you know like

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
on here but actually we're like we're going there.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
So

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
now we understand that this is the core progression. It's just one

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
chord after another. So this feels like now we are poised to understand the circle of fifths Yes exactly.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
So we have arrived we have

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
arrived at the Circle of Fifths I

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
feel like I'm in seventh grade and I'm playing Dungeons and Dragons again.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
And we've just gone through a great adventure a module is used to call them and we are

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
finally we have arrived at the Stony

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
gates of the circle of fifths Nick Britell as our Dungeon Master

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
please lead us in just exactly so. So exactly

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
so we're simplifying this a little bit but essentially a circus is this

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
very common type of corporate action. Let's imagine instead of just these

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
two note chord progressions like going from the

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
five to the one where the bass note goes from the fifth note scale to the

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
first you know.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
What if Actually we keep going and we play more chords

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
after that and what if every chord that we played was just this

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
sequence related by moving the bass note a fifth.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
OK OK So this you're going to play something that's basically just adding five. I'm

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
just I'm basically moving the bass note by a

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
fifth each time. So if you take the bass

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
note we start on C. and I go hear you hear the sound so this is the bass going down

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
if you see these things can move by

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
men or if I go up I

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
go see those are just fifths right. And I'm actually in the room with

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Nick playing the keyboard and I can see. That on the keyboard. Yes just

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
counting exactly

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
we're just we're just we're five down the road. We're just moving these things

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
biasness So if I do that and then I just

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
put chords that we're doing just build basic chords on top of each one of those you

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
get this

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000
sound

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
and you see so you get this thing called a chord

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
progression

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
and you can do it in different types of tonalities that's like the major circle if it's you could do a

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
minor one.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:40.000
OK

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
So it's I see how that is more complicated. We had earlier we had that like a Beethoven

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
E. cadence that sort of like and it's the end of something and then we

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
have that deceptive cadence that was a kind of like a fake out and then this

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
one is just a lot more there's

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
a lot more to it because it's not just one chord to another chord. It's one chord to another

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
chord to another chord it's a series of chords that follows a pattern.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
So this one's interesting because basically the bass notes when you do a circle of fifths you hit

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
every every basic chord of the scale in the process of going through

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
it so in a cool way it's this kind of summary of the chords of a

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
scale and you know to use that number terminology using where you start in like

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
one and you're back at one and that's

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.000
the reason

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
to go because it actually it's like this weird identity of the scale.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
You know and it has this type of sound that in a weird way because you're kind of coming

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
back to the one at the end but you're going through this interesting journey of the chords.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:54.000
I think different people feel differently about the progression but I tend to have this almost kind of nostalgia.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Wistful feeling so here's here's a circle

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
fest.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Sunny. It has. It a little bit feels

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
like graduating sixth grade. Yet it's got a

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
little bit a groove Enos to it exactly. It's got it's got a little bit of life to it

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
so it is like I sort of have a

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
similar feeling of like the style just. Yet it's dynamic at the same time

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
like a dynamic nostalgia exactly what it feels like let me be a real eye as it

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
once again a tone deaf nonmusical person. How is that in Fly Me To

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
The Moon. I still can't quite hear it so here's the thing so this is where it's cool so.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
So in Fly Me To The Moon. It's actually doing that exact thing. Fly Me To

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
The Moon is in a

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
mind when you hear the melody. So the melody

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:54.000
is

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
right. So if you look at our bass notes. It's exactly doing the circle watch so the bass note

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
is

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
yeah OK. Yes So I'm watching him play this and I can see that his left

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
hand the hand playing the bass line is sort of like climbing up and down the

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:13.000
keyboard so basically

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
the left hand is a pattern and then just are circle sets and so

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
that's

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
if you just look at the bass note you see the whole thing.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Can you play us another example I think we heard

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
we you've actually prepared something for us yet shows us

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
how how truly similar.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Yes lots of music is so another another very famous piece that happens

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
to use the circle of fifths is the song I Will Survive. So here's a quick

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.000
example of

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:55.000
that

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
but then I

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
didn't make

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
any.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
So so that is a circle fest basically where it's the same and actually it's even in the same key

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
as the family of the moon example where

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000
I

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
see the blood and it's just doing the same

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
exact thing again it's the base the base. That it arriving this and you're just building chords on top of

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
that progression using that aggression and so this was something that actually I discovered over the weekend.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
If you take the Fly Me To The Moon audio

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
file and you mash it up wiv I will survive the

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
bizarre thing is they actually fit on top of each other perfectly which is kind of crazy

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
and shows that they're really using the same harmonies. So this is and this is something that people can mash

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
up culture this is why a lot of this stuff exists so I'll play this example and you'll see that they literally are the

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:02.000
same

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:12.000
there

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:25.000
and then here's a piece by Mozart that does the same thing.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:25.000
They're

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:25.000
all

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
the same basic credible. It's totally incredible.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:31.000
So all

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
of these that it's really cool deejays are really just scammers they're just exploiting a

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
fundamental component of music here because look I

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
mean do you sit down. Do you say to yourself. Like I think this is a moment where I'd like to

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000
deploy a fifth. Mike do you actually like sort of had that internal conversation.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Yeah absolutely.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
There's It depends you know if I'm especially when with writing film music where you're

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
really trying to think about things that are happening dramatically in

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000
a film and you're trying to. I gin the way that your music can emotionally relate to those things.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Yeah absolutely there's a sort of you know there's like a tool kit in the vocabulary of different types

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
of chords and different things

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
and you know you have everything from you know these are you know different types of chords

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
feel like different things so minor chords have their sort of feel and you know

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
most augmented chords have this kind of kind of bill and major chords of that sort of feel you know.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
So everything has its own feeling and composing is that fun experimentation and search for

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
different types of emotional

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
journeys and so the circle of fifths is kind of like a tool in your toolkit as a

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
composer sure I love the service and in fact as as

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
we realize recently. There is a there is a partial circle fits in the

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:59.000
surprisingly awesome new music.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
So

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.000
basically

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
I do a little circle with a sequence inside and that gives this that same kind of

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
feeling where you're cycling through these different things but then coming home and that's

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
really cool man. I once

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
again whenever we do the show I always just feel like why didn't someone tell me

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
this in third grade.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
This is been amazing my mind is officially done I'm going to be looking for the circle if it's everywhere. I'm going

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
to become a circle of fifths detective amazing.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Surprisingly awesome theme song is obviously by Nicholas to sell our add music and five build

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000

incredible and we've got something new that you might really like every week we have to leave.
