McKay and read up about here we should say parents. If you cannot tell from that beginning of the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000

sick burns from this episode so he should take

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
precautions. Adam. Can you start us off do you have a favorite insult.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
There is one sort of legendary in Seoul you'll hear a lot of comedy writers talk about from.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The great shows Sanford and Son was very popular in the seventy's into the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
eighty's and it involved Red Fox of course with deal

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
with Aunt Esther and she would insult him he would insult her

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
they didn't like each other and at one point he dropped one of the great insult lines of all

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
time honor you know

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm coming with me I could stick guilt phase is going and make some of the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
really good.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I've

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
heard that line mentioned many times as sort of a a perfect insult in the sense

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
of its economy the leap it

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
takes his victories is a perfect replica of a gorilla that you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
just have to press it into dough they'd obviously be big cookies but that's our

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
rights Yeah that's an all time great.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I just don't get like. I I I guess I get it

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
but

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
it's but you do have to watch it as a full episode to kind of get the vibe of it because it pulls

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
you in and man oh man there are some amazing lines from that lot of comedy

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.000
writers talk about

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that another thing that you brought up when we when we first started talking about insults

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
was the Don

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Rickles in the comedy world. Most people consider Don Rickles

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the master insult comic and there's a good people out there like Jeffrey Ross has become really

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
famous for the comedy central roast I think now Tosh Ola's euro is incredible.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
She's been on fire lately every time I see Iran though so there's some there's some fantastic and soul

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
comics but I think the King of Kings is Don

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Rickles disabled and here gentleman here where you're from so if I mess.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
New Jersey you had

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
a crowd. So this is from a roast it's Don Rickles pressing Jerry

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Lewis name sir. And he said I never heard of

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
you two which first name is Dennis

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and Bill Landis. Get

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
up these people that are close

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
to Kerry we got a dumbbell believe

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that yes he was proud he made the seating arrangements

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and the poppy

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
pot belly. Nobody

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
knows the stuff.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So that's pretty that's by Raechel standards. That's pretty tame that clip. I

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
remember seeing a clip of him just really simply up onstage looks at a

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
rather large woman wearing a brightly colored dress and goes Hello ma'am. How are you that's a

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
beautiful

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
dress Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do crowd goes crazy.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I watched probably like an hour of Don Rickles stuff looking for something

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
that I for one felt like I could play on a podcast that children do occasionally. And.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I think for me one of the things that was challenging was just

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
like it is so specific to a time in a place a lot of times like

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
he's doing a roast where like

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
he's making jokes to Dean Martin about Frank

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Sinatra in one hundred seventy four. About something that happened in Brooklyn in one thousand nine hundred eighty eight and like

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
it's like flying over my head when I think I want to hear that.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Yeah it's. That was a tough one for me but another one that you brought

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
up. Wow what an honor the White House Correspondents Dinner to

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
actually this is even comparing two thousand and six he's doing basically a roast of President George

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
W. Bush everybody asked for personnel changes. So the White House has personnel

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
changes and then you're right. Oh they're just rearranging the deck chairs on the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Titanic for sort of a terrible

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
metaphor there that this is ministration is not thinking this

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
is ministration is soaring if anything they are rearranging the

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
deck chairs on the hidden

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
burn either those very funny like I laugh at

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
that first off it's obviously a lot more current So kind of the context is easier for an

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
audience to get into but I would also say that's one of the great

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
historic comedy moments of all time. Well because that was a moment where Bush did have

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
that popularity. He had the press

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
cowed and not only does coke bear roast a masterfully but he does it from

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
the perspective of loving him. I obviously come from an improv background

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
in theater and writing and and I remember try teaching a bunch of kids on

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
the South Side of Chicago at Marshall High improv

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and first two weeks that we did it they all just insulted each other and they were funny. They were

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
good insults but you can't do anything with that you kind of just stop it so we

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
kept working and eventually the kids stopped insulting each other and started supporting each other and

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
building scenes but I never

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
really thought of insults as having any kind of like you know substance.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Of bottom to them or any kind of purpose. I'm

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
definitely open to being proven wrong on that though.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
OK Well so truly I do believe there is something more to be learned from insults and that's what

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
this whole episode is about we're going to

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
go figure out who these insults are for who they are against and what they're

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
for and so to get into that question. I knew right away who I wanted to

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
call because the thing we're really focusing on this episode is funny insults clever

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
ones and I think your improv kids in

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Chicago would love these people. I'm Jessica Langley. I'm Ben

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Kinsley and we are part of the collective Janks

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
archive along with a third member who is not in this room. He's a dad and lives in North

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Carolina with his baby and his wife and his full time job. His name's

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Charleston Crosby. So

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Jessica. Ben Anderson they are artists and one day. Ben turned up these

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
recordings from the one nine hundred seventy S. of people singing really like vulgar

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
vulgar nursery rhymes from when they were kids and the three of them are listening to these recordings and I

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
just cracking up but they also felt sort of wistful about them

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
because they didn't have any songs like this of their

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
own but then they realized there was something that they shared on the

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
playground something that did pass from kid to kid and that would jump from town to

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
town when your cousins came through you know mama

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
jokes because we were all you know were children of the ninety's and Gerson and I we knew

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
a bunch right and I said something like you know your mom so fat she jumped up in the air and got

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
stuck and then Gerson said cut you down so low you have to hold a sign

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
that says Don't spit can't swim and then he had all these others that were

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.000
totally weird

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
like only one like this is the but this is a deal like justin just won and we just both sat

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
there like whoa you know so

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
many Here's a sample of some of Justin's greatest hits. If you will when the

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Lord is giving out.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Know that he's always had roses in the. For a big red one. OK down so

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
you could sing your feet off the curb your most supportive of milkshake

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
all away when the Lord was giving out

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
brains you thought he said rain when to sell shelter your house is a small the cockroaches

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
walk home but your mama so tall she did a car will and kick Jesus in the face.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
We knew he was from Alabama but like is this something that is specific to Alabama and then he said that you

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
know what do you guys call Jags and we were like what what is

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
the excuse me

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
the jank and say Yes that's what he calls it is the jank Is this

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
like insult joke and I think with a Mr talking about like well what do we call him and I think

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I remember calling him decisions.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I grew up in the you know seventy's eighty's. Yeah

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
we called them disses they were definitely disses burns.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I grew up in Maryland and we call them snaps

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
we were really struck by how the structure of his jokes were really different and how it

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
like the idea that you could insult somebody for being tall.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Is new and you know or like the cut you down so low

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
that

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
whatever or when the Lord was giving out something like these are dead well these are

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
different jokes so I don't know any of

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
these so this is how they're project the jinx our cause is born and

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
they start to go out and look for these jokes. I usually explain that

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
we do this we have a worldwide kind of archive basically an oral

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
tradition and usually known.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I don't remember I don't remember a good way of getting people it's like do you remember anything your grandma's tell you.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Gramma's are secretly the best most insulting people in the planet I think.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Grandmothers are are really filthy. Their favorite jink they collected from a

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Finnish grandmother and it has to do with a lingonberry and it is unbelievable.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
You can go here that jinx archived or

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
it's one of many legendary lingonberry insults. Which we're all

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
very familiar with the lingonberry slams you know these guys they actually

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
went all over the world collecting these things and they started to

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
see themes

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
or crop up every place they went to collect Janks Mexico City

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Pittsburgh Berlin every place had a different type of insult that came

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
up really

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
often So for example when they went to Belfast in Northern Ireland.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
A ton of the Janks they call them slag and there a ton of them are about people not

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
being useful here

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
is useful as a bag a cap. Here is useful as a chocolate teapot Pierce. Yes

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
The last have her sunglasses on the guy with no

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
airs and in Finland a lot of the Janks there about what we would probably here in the US

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
call having a screw loose or not having all of your marbles. Just like on Ben we're collecting them in this part

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
of Finland in the southwest right across the Baltic Sea from Sweden. And there's a

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Swedish speaking population there so they have their own set of Swedish screw

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
loose

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Janks but there's a they're totally different from the Finnish language screw

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
loose jank So here's here's one in

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Swedish hundred dollars. That translates to he doesn't have

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
them all at

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
home and here is one in Finnish So let's look like a couple

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
he doesn't have all the Nazis in his bunker.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Well could you please go and like. That's

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
real wow I love

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
that that's that's an indicator of a lack of sanity. When you when you when you want

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
to say your bunker is Nazi free if you are

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
saying I don't know I don't know the justification the Finns must've had a real bad.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Whoa.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
But so another thing they notice as they're as they're collecting these that is

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
that in the US a lot of the Janks are about class like about how poor you are that

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
something uniquely American and they said that when they've been out collecting and the rest of the world

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
they haven't found as many of the. But in the U.S. We have tons of

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
them your mama so broke. She can't get into a free concert.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
If you're still poor your house so small when you order P.T.S.D..

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
So I went to aus. I was hungry and I opened a refrigerator and

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
know a bunch of roses and I

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
think

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
some of these types of Jenks the categories of insults like you are not useful or you have a screw loose. Those are

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
very geographically specific but then there are categories that you do find everywhere so

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
like maternal insults. Those are everywhere.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I know than most Center just among the much influence

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
ons of OK so that's a French one and it is your momma so ugly she has to wear

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
makeup to go on the radio. That's solid. Here's what I got that's in Portuguese your

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
mama so fat. When you have to drive around her in the car you run out of

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
gas to a million. Don't go to the Clinton face beside above all to Delancey kissing

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.000
his little

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
cock. And this one's in German and with the full set is

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
a beautiful person tied up you know Mukhtar is so fat her blood type is.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Gnutella kind

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
of incredible people insulting each other's moms everywhere you

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
go and it's not always structured like an actual yo mama joke but you know

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
it seems like a lot of times it is it also something oddly sweet about it it kind

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
of points to how much we all on planet earth love our

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
mothers right. You know for sure like you can go after somebody as mom and it's going to be

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
like kind of hard.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
What should we do a. Your mother joke let's make one up on the spot about your mama so hairy.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Oh I'm a so hairy your mama so hairy the wolf band borrowed

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
hair gel from

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
are not great not for anyone to judge myself

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
honestly. I just got my hair cut so I should be able to do

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
this your mama's back so hairy that the salon assistant tried to sweep

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
it

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
but I feel like you're just humoring me but what. Going here making up the Obama jokes

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
it's part of this larger tradition an African-American tradition in the U.S. called

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
the dozens

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and kids basically like make up insults on the spot and then they throw met each other it's a duel.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
That's the dozens. So here's Ben

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
again we started doing a lot of research on traditions of insulting traditions

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
like this and the dozens it's really fascinating. We ended up going to Mexico City and

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
we learned about something there called the Al Gore which is a rhyming game like the

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
dozens and again that's like in the moment flying back and

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
forth and it turns out these insult games appear in a lot of places not just in the U.S.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and Mexico but Innuit culture and Turkish culture and these back and

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
forth things are called insult rituals.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
That's according to Gerry knew who he wrote sticks and stones the philosophy of insults and he says these

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
rituals are used in some places to settle debts or disputes. Jerry says it's

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
a way to win without actual physical violence.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Well it goes back to insults being concerned with power and who

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
dominates whom.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
So this is a new idea here. The idea that insults are about power and when Jerry told us

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
we got really excited as it made us

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
realize how important insults are to the dynamics

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
between people there about who's got the upper hand in a given situation and

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
how you can insult that person to take that upper hand away from

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
that there is a difference between what I would call ritual insults or playful

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
or friendly insults and insults which are more direct forms

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
of aggression and attempts at domination.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
What what defines that line what sets the parameters there.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Well I think it has to do with the intention that people see behind them that is

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
if someone sees a joking friendly intention. That's different from seeing

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
an attempt to denigrate lesson put down and so

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
on what makes that feel good why. That's that's the. On its face

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
kind of counterintuitive like it feels good to be insulted by

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
certain people in a certain way.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
There's a kind of controlled aggression that is you get to

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
vent to to express feelings that. Because they're

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
not received as true assaults are acceptable.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Jerry really drove home the point that insults are this way of keeping things in check.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
You know it's like when you're a kid the guidance counselor is like you know if you're

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
mad punch a pillow instead of punching someone in the face. It's words. Do you have a

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
favorite insult.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Well I guess. The one the pops into mind is to place.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
During a

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
party in the one nine hundred seventy S. when. Gore of a

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Dom made some sort of nasty comment about the most recent book

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
by Norman Mailer and they were literary rivals. You know over many years.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Anyway this is this remark somehow really got to Norman

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Mailer and he punched him he punched old Gore

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Vidal and decked him so that but I was on the floor and the bit that

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
I like is that Gore Vidal had the presence of mind as he got up from the floor to

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
say once again. Words have failed.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Norman to be Doc

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
composed to get popped in the mouth at a party and get up and

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
hit him with that line that's impressive good for Gore of a Dollar

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Man which again is sort of a model of the insult rituals like the dozens

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
where one way of losing is precisely by running out of

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
words and resorting to your fist instead of giving a clever insulting response.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
You know to whatever your opponent just said that so

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
it's it's a nice illustration of that I think among sort of literary giants

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
not teenage boys but

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
still I feel like. That's a pretty compelling case insults have a clear cultural value. Well I

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
mean let's see this.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
For starters. I mean if you're talking about people getting aggression out in dealing

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
with hostility through clever insults. It almost becomes beautiful at

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
that point.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Yeah and how insults and help people deal with some pretty

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
intense systemic hostility throughout history that is coming up after

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.000
the

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
break the library is open one can read you thought

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Bill.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
This episode surprisingly autumn is brought to you by Ford Motor Company. My name is small Buddha.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000
I am a engineer a port a company. Roger Trombley I'm an active safety engineer at Ford Motor Company.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
How do you guys know each other we met in college or sophomore

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
year and how do you know each other now we'll know we're married and we also both work at Ford a few

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
years back. Schimmel and Roger took what Ford called the mother of all road trips.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
That's its official name by the

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
way it has an acronym. Mort. It's a cross-country road trip that lets Ford

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
engineers test out new features one available feature Schimmel and Roger tried out on their road

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
trip active park assist

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
active park assist A.P.A. which helps your vehicle parallel park your hands off the

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
wheel you're just controlling the gas and the brakes and the car parks itself and

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
we just love this so I remember a D.C. we would do that over and over any time we found a spot

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
we probably like crazy would park and then pull out and park and.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
I was going to ask who's the better parallel parker but I guess like the car

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
is a car. Did you get into any fights. No I don't think

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
so because the principle temperature no fight together in the car eight

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
to ten hours a day. That's really impressive. We are meant to be together. You know chips and other

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
things

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
forward engineering ways to make parking

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
easier and couples. Happy or could afford dot com flash awesome to learn

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
more

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
from media this is surprisingly awesome. I'm Rachel Ward and I am Adam

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
a case. And so far we've been talking

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
about insults in terms of people insulting each other face to

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
face but I think if we're really being honest with ourselves the place where

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
insults really thrive. We all know the answer to this

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
the internet. Adam what's the ORs thing that anyone's ever said to you on the Internet.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Really going to make the I mean I've read. I've read stuff that looks like someone was

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
possessed by a demon and really wanted to make me cry

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
on the Internet that usually you know physical

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
just it's like it's like a violin in ten. They're not because I don't care if someone

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
can criticize my movies my writing so I can say so and it isn't funny or interesting. That's all

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
fine but when it's just that kind of dark blunt attack.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
I remember when we were at S N

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
L Very early on with the Internet Will Ferrell was like I'm never

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
reading any of that and I was like. I like to read it sometimes and it took me

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
about ten years to finally get where he's at we're like I'm never reading the comments

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
section again. All I can say is it is not helpful.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Yeah I mean trolls

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
are trolls or Absolutely. They're the worst They're just like they're lazy

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
it's like they're barely trying they just go for like the lowest easiest blow but that's

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
not what this episode is about this episode is not about weak sauce insults this episode is

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
the good insults really funny stuff artful stuff.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
What they've done the poor Kermit Kermit was my childhood friend with the Muppets.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Now he says sipping tea

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
everywhere says this is to Mika Bradley Hobbs she's a history professor at

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Florida Memorial University and you have probably seen the image that she's talking about it's a picture of Kermit the

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Frog from the

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Muppets. He's just like very genteelly sipping a mug of tea and a lot of the times

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
when you see this image it's got the phrase but that's none of my business written across the

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
bottom of it and that means

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
font that font is called impact and it's been around since one thousand nine

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
hundred sixty

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
five more facts like that in our newsletter subscribers get Media dot com slash off

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
I'm back to Kermit drinking this mug of tea.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Right so here's just how to Mika explains what sipping tea

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
is there something foul going on but I'm not going to say anything because I'm so busy

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
enjoying my hot beverage that I'm not going to give both

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
That's what leg Twitter has given the flu is what a brilliant contribution

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
to American culture.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
I'm imagining like half of our listeners just want. Not another

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
description Black Twitter on a pod gets and then the other half of our listeners are like

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
what Twitter. So if you know what I'm talking about please be patient with us

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
while everyone gets on the same page.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
It's the the Black way says one on Twitter. When black people

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
congregate the a hash tag on Twitter and have

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
a have a conversation about whatever's happening

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
and pop culture politics.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
To Because book is called democracy abroad lynching at home racial

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
violence in Florida her research for it was going around the state

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
collecting oral histories about lynching really really intense

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
stuff. So you can maybe understand why she needs this

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
pressure valve on Twitter this community of like minded people who are all trying to process

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
their experiences in kind of a similar

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
way we have had a very long history of being

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
denigrated ourselves and trying to turn that integration into

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
something that we could could live with by

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.000
laughing at

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
it but also mastering it as a weapon has been part

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
of our birth. Right in this country in particular there have just been

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
some wonderful evenings that I've been able to spend laughing myself to

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
sleep but watching my

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
timeline. For the news

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
feed in and Twitter. It is a

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
comfort that is born of a lot of discomfort and if you look at black

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
history and the things that we've had to endure in this country.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
So yes it's bittersweet. But it is hella fun

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
and it is really fun when we're talking to me we can just hear in her voice. How much

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
she loves this part of the Internet and how much sense of community she feels there

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
for example. She told us about Starbucks trying to get people to use the

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
hash tag race together they want people to go buy a coffee and then sit down and

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
like talk through the racial situation in America like right as

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
the world was trying to process a bunch of incidents where black people have been shot by the police and it was like

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
a nice idea

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
but it didn't go over

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
great the Black Twitter response and that hash tag was a way to really point out how

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
foolish the idea was but also have a little bit of fun at

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Starbucks right. I mean they wanted a conversation and they got a congressman they got

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
a Congress and not the one they were hoping for but they got a conversation just

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
the names that were coming across

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Malcolm espresso latte my people

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
go who was in the other

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
one was hilarious. And this of course was during the time

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
that Ferguson was still very very hot topic and that was one that had a picture

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
of there and Wilson officer who shot and killed. Mike Brown and it

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
said feared for my safety like they drink

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
tea CA. And

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
like you know it's tragic it's bringing in something that's happening in the real world but it's also

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
using it. I mean is this kind of perfect. Chad again part of the Get

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:01.000
this

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
and so you can hear some you know. Caution there from to make a she says it's fine when people keep it

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
on the Internet the risk is when insults spill over in the real world.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Yeah her concern is that sometimes stuff on Twitter escalates instead of

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
relieving pressure so to bring back the idea of the of punching a pillow it's like

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
if punching the pillow doesn't make you feel any less angry instead of just get you all riled up and then you go out

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
and start punching a bunch of random strangers on the

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
street there's an interesting interplay between what happens virtually And what happens

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
when when there's flesh and blood involved because we're humans will fail and many of our

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
bank

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
communities. That's a life or death thing I have nothing but respect.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
My name and people fearing me are thinking of man a certain way is all I have to

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
hold onto and that something is very alone even going back to dueling and

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
the eighteenth and nineteenth century to go in American South.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
So we are about to travel a very long distance in not a lot of time here so stick with

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
us this respect culture that to me goes talking about is coming from a

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
very very heavy place in American history. We're about to go for Meems

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
on the Internet to slavery.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
When you're talking about African-American culture I think it goes back to slavery and the

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:18.000
use

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
of indirection where you know in a in a slave

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
environment you could never say anything

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
explicitly this is Patrick Johnson he's a professor of African-American studies

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
and performance studies at Northwestern University and he introduced us to this

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
idea of indirection.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
It's basically plausible deniability.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Yeah when you're in a situation where someone has a lot of power over you you have to cut them

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
down indirectly. So for example during

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
slavery talking back to to to

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
master in a direct way could actually get you killed

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
lynched or beaten and so. Slaves

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
develop indirect forms of

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
communicating such as not looking

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
a slave master in the eye. So how something like that then

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
get

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
to become a part of American culture is my mother would

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
never allow me to look her directly in the ivy if she

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
were chastising me because that was seen as a form of disrespect

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
and it also is a survival strategy for

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
instance again to bring a

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
very contemporary example is when you're pulled over when you're

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
a black person you know not to talk back not

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
to resist because you might get killed.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
So the talk that people have developed to express their displeasure how indirection relates

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
to insults. That's actually the same thing to Mika was describing on Twitter.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
It's shade. It's in folks that are so restrained and so clever

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
that sometimes the target does not even realize that they're being insulted.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Here's how each Patrick uses shade He's also a performer. So he gets invited to see a lot of

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
other people's

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
performances and so I've been in situations in which I have

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
been invited to a friend's show or someone claimed

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
tense and I really really thought it was bad to really bad.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
So after the show rather

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
than lying. I will say something

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
like Oh my God you were on that stage. Oh my

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
God you were there.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
You

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:51.000
owe you would. Oh you were just on that stage.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
I'm very good I've had the same experiences talking about where you have to go to play these and it's

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
always tough and I've certainly done things or been in things where I can tell. Someone doesn't like

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
it they'll usually say something

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
like Wow that must a taken a lot of

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000
work that's a good one you praise the work effort.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Yes So it's that's in direction. Here's another example for me Patrick if

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
you have friends who are pregnant. You should listen up you might need this

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
little one one of my nephews was born we went to the hospital to see

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
him and he

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
was really tragically ugly I mean he was just a really

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
hideous baby and so my brother was just being mean but

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
I and of course you know we can say anything. And so all

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
my says

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
is look. The baby. Just

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
look at it.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
So far be that's what's awesome about and so

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
how creative you can get with communicating something in a way

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
that sounds so pleasant but you're just cutting somebody and they don't even know

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.000
they're

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
bleeding so I went to Patrick in to make a talk about this they're talking specifically about the

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
black Southern experience but he Patrick says pretty much every minority has come up with their own forms of

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
verbal play even minorities within minorities the Irish get as speakers

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
even kids have their own strategies for

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
insult right. Patrick's work is informed by gay culture

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
and he was saying that if you've ever heard someone say something like oh girl he just read you for filth.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
That's coming from gave her an ocular a reader to get read that's an insult. That's stone

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
other insider term it's more language that is special for your community

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
so insults make you feel like you're part of a group and that group is protecting you asked

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
X. wad or my daughters were just saying that the other day. Then there's the other

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
side of this coin getting insulted in front of a

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
group right. How power dynamics change when there are other people what. CHANG And

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
that brings us to another

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
one's OK I am Mark Olsen I

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
am a lecturer at the University of M. then and I think

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
my title is Ph D. art. Dr Alton perhaps I don't

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
I sounds really weird and official but I guess that's it.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
You aren't it. You deserve it. Yeah.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Marta is a psycho linguist in the Netherlands and one of the things she studies is

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
humiliation and she was interested in how humiliation and shame play

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
into

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
insults what I wanted to know was if you know that you

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
are being a good or by a larger group of people. Does that

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
change your perception of

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
instill some margin or team decided to measure this the use in the E.G. an

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
electro and suffer a gram. Basically they put a shower cap full of electrodes

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000
on their research subjects heads and then they insult them a lot.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
So we actually use insulting senses in something in

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Dutch so you sort of personal info. They're very gender.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Though they're specific are smart that only works when and other curse words that only work

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
for men and we need sentences that would work for both genders.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
So I can beat them up if you want to yet

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000
totally I find you to Fogarty think there is me.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
I am with you is so terrible that I would rather not see you

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.000
again your life is worth less than the voice of consent.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
That's a great insult in the company of others you also behave completely

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
inappropriate Lee where when I hear you I

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
feel disgust and ripple the way you handle things it makes me

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
think like Argonne you say some of these to me in Dutch.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Oh yes sure of that you know who are full of loathing and us care.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
A Human Being own cousin. Well Miss look from the warden events they're going to make up

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
a little for song The boy's uncle who I think. You

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
know look into the local Look ignored some

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
three's personas you know. If that's a whole lot before pile into

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
not all of them. It was that hill who did the men's Jacobi the manga in

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
the deathless all Kong just to see

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
you so well people are hearing these insults. They're wearing

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
the electrode shower cap and Marcus team is measuring how quickly their brains

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000
processing activity is responding to the

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
insults and then they play them a bunch more insults but this time the insult is

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000
accompanied by the image and the sound of a bunch of people laughing on a computer screen.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Marsha sent us a clip of the laughing and it is straight up maniacal Oh.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Basically my entire A ninth and tenth grade years of school summed up.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Perfectly and as a control for this research they also did the same thing with

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
compliments play a bunch of compliments then play them with the laughter and here's what

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:10.000
they

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
learned when we found. I guess not surprisingly that when

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
people know that they're being laughed at when they know that they're being up

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
there that the president of the

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Insel has

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
increased the can you tell me about why we perceive

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
insults more intensely when we are being laughed

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
at as a person. We need other

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
people to respect the current tech being and

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
well obviously it's worse because we can

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
lose the peer group as humans we

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
feel and think I guess intrinsic need

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
to belong. When combined with excess.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Losing our peer group that makes you really a stand

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
back and so this is the thing. It's a double edged sword a

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
really snappy witty insult can make us feel like we belong to a group like we

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
get it like how to Mika has this community on Black Twitter.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000
But if we feel like the group is turning against us insults feel even worse

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
we feel like we're losing power like we're not safe.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
OK So Adam. Do you want to hear the insult expert's favorite insult by all means.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Yes I was thinking about did you

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
think

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Oh I think I like that one.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Why do you like that one in particular

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
I don't know it is kind of funny and I'd like to

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000
laugh when I'm in NY then. That's real.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000
This is the way that we in Florida or each other.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
I would actually argue that's beautiful. I mean keeping our

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
our bombs clean is something that saves

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
lives it's something that's courteous.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
I've never looked at it that way but actually calling someone an ass is a very beautiful

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
beautiful thing Rachel. Will you call me and ask why but I'll respond appropriately.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
How that feels like a trick question. But

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000
what Martin is saying about having this specific thing when she says it's your husband

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
it's very endearing it's part of their like culture as a husband wife unit. It would be

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
way different if she said that to somebody else.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
So that's kind of the essence of this topic insults are born out of a specific

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.000
context and that's why what is clever what constitutes a clever insult is different for different people.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
I mean it seems to me like really what the line is on the

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
insults are are the it was sold something that you're laughing at because

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
your group bond. Is so strong that you can let your ego down to

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
laugh at yourself to laugh at other people because you know what we're super tight with each

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
other and no matter what's said we're going to be tight.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
That's a thing. Like insults can show people like hey I'm really smart

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
I'm funny we're like kin to each other but they can also be kind of dangerous they can

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
like demonstrate like I

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
will burn you Dick you know it's funny you could almost trace everything especially when you talk

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
about comedy about are we part of the pack are we part of the

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
group or with being kicked out of the group. For being kicked out of the group it's not

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
fun if it's solidifying us in the group it's awesome. And you can laugh at Don

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Rickles and because you know they're all cool and they're tight with each other and they're joking around.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
So we started this episode like we both agreed insults are

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
hilarious but you weren't quite sure if they had like a

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
value where you now with that idea.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Oh I don't think there's any doubt they have a value I mean from hearing hearing all

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
this I mean at the least it's just all of us taken

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
the taking ourselves down a peg or taking ourselves less seriously. That's always

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
good when you get to the level of Kobe or challenging. You know

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
a questionable government the leader of the country right to his

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
face it can become Horowitz when you hear the story of a

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
culture that's been through like a trauma and racism finding a way to

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
communicate with each other in a way that unique to each other so they can have a shared

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
experience that almost becomes beautiful.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Yeah there's there's definitely an incredible amount of value to it and then when they're really good

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
they are just funny and there's let's face it nothing better than

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:53.000
laughing really hard.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:53.000

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
