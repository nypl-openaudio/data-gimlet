00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Hey B.J. and X.. Are you ready for this week's episode do you think.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Do I need to be ready in like a different way than normal. I'm just trying to carry him

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
in this one the weird one. OK we're done.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
OK So this is a story that I've been reporting for the last month.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And it's honestly kind of taken over my life but it starts small start very

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
small with this guy named Eric Yearwood about two and a half years ago. Eric embarked

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
on this quintessential New York life change where he quit his job as a teacher in Florida

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and moved to the city to become an

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
actor but it didn't go so well I haven't made the kind of

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
career I wanted for myself I guess and kind of fallen back on some

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
plan B.'s That's a tough racket really tough and especially when

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I'm I moved here and I had a

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
fiance and because I wasn't making a lot of money and didn't

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
seem like I was headed towards a stable lifestyle we split up. So I

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
was pretty down and out mid year two thousand and

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
fifteen to make ends meet. Eric got jobs doing stuff like building stage. His her fancy

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
shanty events and some graphic design work but Eric was not living his

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
best life. I think when I was in college I wanted to be like a renaissance man you know I wanted

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
to experience all of life and you know but then you get a little older and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
you realize hey I've just got this little pocket of stuff I can do

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and kind of be content with that we're getting real heavy going here.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Sorry to be Debbie Downer here. I didn't know what to say but and the same questions

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I guess.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Eric was in the city following his dreams and he's going nowhere. And then magic entered his

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
life in the form of an

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
e-mail you know it was basically something like you know hello I'm a performance artist I go by

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
the name of Sir do Lou I have something that you might fit you know or

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
this role and I was wondering if you might be willing you know for several hundred dollars

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
to participate.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
These are do Lou.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Eric still has no idea how or why this person found him in fact Eric barely knows

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
anything about them beyond the fact that this person calls themselves are doing their due

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
who took Eric and made him part of

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
something that became bigger than he could have ever imagined. But even calls themselves are

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
dealing that's their name. That's what they go

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
by it's like a it's like I'm on a new pseudonym. So I know pseudonym.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It sounds

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
like I mean maybe it's a common name somewhere it sounds like something from what was the movie

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
was David Bowie and they're amazing and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
scary it is very funny that you mention that that movie is called labyrinth. And after exchanging a

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
few emails Eric agreed to go to do a studio and this is what he said about meeting

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
her she was wearing robes. When I when we met so that was very odd.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
She looked like she was. Like maybe

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
a villager from the labyrinth.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Was she wearing with a cloak. She was. It was more it wasn't a cloak it was more

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
like kind of like a row. Said like does she keep or something with some sort

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
of embroidered symbols or something down the front of it she was a little bit kind of.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Ha I don't know mystical is a weird word but that's the way she

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.000
seemed

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
somehow Eric said that she was friendly but kind of inscrutable You know I mean. And then

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
she starts explaining what she wants from him.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
She just said I want to create something viral.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So this was fall of last year after Peter at the video of a rat carrying a slow speeds down a

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
flight of subway stairs went viral and suddenly the internet couldn't get enough videos

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
of rats carrying things and their due apparently wanted to manufacture one of

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
these videos. So she says to Eric. Here's the

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
plan. It's going to be a video starring you and a rat. But not just any subway or

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
at a read that I train. You'll sit on the subway the rat will

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
crawl onto

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
you step on your phone. Take a picture of

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
itself and then you're unfeigned surprise and run away and

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I will be recording it. But

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
then the rat would need to be able to unlock his phone. Yes.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So there is a level

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
of artifice involved in this right. He has to unlock his

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
phone pretend to be asleep. Let the rat crawl on him take the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
picture and then jump up frightened and run away but even if you're faking a

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
little bit that's still like an extremely well trained rat P.J. you have no

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
idea that was the rat there.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Yeah the rat was there and there were other rats too. And so they would run this

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
maze they would leap over these little obstacles they would go through there was like a

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Leica like a little pool that they would swim across to retrieve certain

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
things and she had them trained in a way that was pretty amazing.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Is amazing. It is

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
amazing when I saw what she was doing with the rats. It went from

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
being like OK this is just a. Like I'm helping somebody make a web series

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
or something to. Wow this person is doing something big

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
this isn't just some Mickey Mouse operation. No pun

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
intended in a couple days later they meet. At about four in the morning in the subway.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
They're doing shows up dressed as a civilian with no road so as not to draw attention to

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
herself and she brings another person to film the whole thing so that she is free to do the

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
right wrangling and initially we were going to actually take the video on a

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
subway car but when we

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
went down into the subway. We couldn't find an empty

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
car that was empty long enough so we at some

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
point she kind of called inaudible and said let's do it just on

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
the platform. OK So we found a platform that was

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
empty

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
enough and. We had peanut

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
butter smeared on the phone and they put the rat on top of

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
me and then took it from there. Where was the peanut butter on

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
the phone. It was at the spot where you press the

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:14.000
button.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
need and.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
It appears that came card actually and then the only one that loves selfies rats apparently like

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.000
them

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
to their do took the video and sent it to a Connecticut T.V. station posing as someone

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
called Don Richards and that's how selfie rap was born and it was

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
everywhere for a couple days it became the weird news story on the eleven o'clock news all over the country.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
It was blurry and you couldn't tell that it was airing. But the video is seen

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.000
millions of

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
times in the process he's dropped a cell phone which somehow snapped a photo of

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
the imposing critter Richard caught the whole thing on video and now the sleeping

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
man has a forever memento of selfie rat. Christina bear

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
PIX eleven

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
News.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:14.000
What is the mouse like in the photo. I can show you a picture of it.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.000
If

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
you look like some it's like pretty Valarie but it makes them look like.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Like a rat from like the Muppets like it makes them look really cute because it's just like you see like the pink of his nose and

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
like I don't know

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000
it's like that I mean it's adorable.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
at this point I'm asking myself what kind of person puts this

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Herculean effort into this politically in consequential Ratto in

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Eric says to me that is Urdu told him that selfie

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
rat selfie right is just the

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
beginning she has a big vision and she was describing

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
the project as a piece a puzzle piece in this

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
grand tapestry of illusions that she wants to create in New

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
York City.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Wow yeah she would say you know like

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:16.000
the world isn't prepared for what I have in store.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.000
You

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
know just things that are just like OK they're kind of enigmatic head

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
scratchers but after seeing her do studio. Eric was ready to believe

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
her a lot of the things I was looking at I didn't really understand

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
like she had there were these the geometric shapes that she had cobbled

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
together from iron and wood and she had like up.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Remember that was like a big suit made

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
of hair it looked like human hair didn't look like for so that

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
was bizarre. That's just bizarre and then she had a lot of. There were a lot

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
of like drills and industrial stuff that she uses to make

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
bigger objects I guess.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Eric told me that all the stuff inside. Studio the suit of human hair the shapes made of iron and

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
wood all of those things that he couldn't quite

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
understand they're part of her master plan to unleash something huge a

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
New York City.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Wow So she's like an art

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
villain but is she an art villain. I just watched how is

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
she villainous in this situation. Well she's saying she's going to unleash a series

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
of allusions Well the thing you heard a hero who was talking about a unleashing anything but

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.000
particularly

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
allusions again I am I'm paraphrasing but magician should work with consent.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Magicians do allusions all the time magicians are like on the villainous gradient.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Anyway. So part of doing this project was that Eric wasn't supposed to say anything about it to

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
anyone and he wouldn't have were it not for the fact that some

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
person anonymously contacted the website Gothamist and said listen

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
this selfie right video is a

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
fake and to this day we have no idea who was the contact the

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Gothamist but whoever it was they said you know this video is fake.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I know the guy who is in it. His name's Eric. Wow. And the author of the article contacted Erik and

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
was like hey the jig is up. I know this was you and so he was like Yeah all right I'll talk

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
to you about it so governments put up the article but the big headline wasn't even about

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
selfie rat. Instead it was about pizza or

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:29.000
at the headline was is pizza rat a hoax.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
talked about little the guy who filmed Peter at and unlike Eric. He says it wasn't state.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
He insists that pizza

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
rat is not a hoax myself and my friend Pat bear. We were heading home from

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
work late one night and we look down and there's a rat dragging

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
a place of pizza twice his size his or her size down the

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
stairs and it was one of those moments where I was like I have to take my phone

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
out and videotape this because my friends will never believe this if I. Just

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
tell them I saw it for met Peter at

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
success was this strange and Larry's moment in his

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
life he did a ton of interviews he made a Peter at T. shirt. It was just

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
a serendipitous right place right time kind of thing. And then he got an e-mail from

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
a reporter AFAM asked the same reporter who had talked to

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Eric and I said OK I just need more context of what you're what you want to

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
know right and check your mail about an hour later again and he's emailed me

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
twice he said he he's pretty sure it was faked.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And to that he needs to hear from me by three thirty if I want to quote in the.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
In the article and also congratulations on pulling off such a hoax which like it's very

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
flattering that he thought I

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
was smart enough to fool the entire world this way

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and I called him and I realized that he was serious and

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
the first thing I did was laugh I was like well one. Like why

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
why do you think this was staged.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Who has the time. Who's the time to do so well.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
So you can answer your question yeah yeah. Who would do this apparently this

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
person when you hear the names or do what do you think when I first

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
thought I thought terrible start

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000
up

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
when I hear the names or do I think of the opening act

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
for Houdini escape exhibit at

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
like vaudeville theater in the thirty's.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
So Matt Little says that he does not know his or do. He says that he's never met Eric.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Matt says that he was not collaborating with some rogue wearing labyrinth well or he was just hanging out in the subway late

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
at night and he saw a rat carrying a ridiculously huge piece of pizza. But if you're a

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
conspiracy theorist.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
There's one thing that ties these two guys together which is they both take classes at the Upright Citizens

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Brigade

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Theater and that's a detail. That Gothamist treats like a smoking gun. OK

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I feel like I can

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
actually maybe dispatch with that specific conspiracy theory. I don't think that the fact that Matt and

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Eric both are affiliated with racism Brigade theater means that they're collaborating just because

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
like you see is like a comedy theater New York that I really really really love I go to shows all the time. I

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
know a nerdy amount about like which performers do what and whatever and anyway.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
All this to say that theater is huge there's like thousands of people who've been associated with it.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Two people both being called what you see Bebo is like two people having done the same

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
like mid to large sized

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
university right. And like I

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
said They say that they don't know each other but when I was talking to Eric the

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
guy who conspired with our do on sell he read. I asked him if he thought that's our DO could

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
also be responsible for Peter

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
at well she's got an armada of

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
highly trained rats to deploy to create viral content. So it does

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
doesn't take a mental leap to think that she could

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
be but is she or do I know that she is I don't have any

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
knowledge of such a

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
thing I even asked Eric to go back and look at the Peter Aveeno for clues.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
So does that rat look plausibly like one

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
of the rats you might have

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
seen. Well I have to say the main rat that or do

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Louie uses his name whiskers on that did

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
look somewhat like whiskers sir doos capable of doing things

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
that you can't even imagine.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And so the.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
The possibility that some people took a video that they

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
didn't know was created by his or do little.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I mean

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
it's it's not beyond the realm of the Imagine a. Oh

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
my God you know

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I went from being like eighty percent sure they key was involved in an isolated performance

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
art piece and this other thing was completely separate to

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
like starting to wonder what's real

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Yeah well I think that selfie rat is inferior to a pizza rat as like a video.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
It's a more complicated thing to stage. And

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
so you know if this person is doing like a series

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
of allusions designed to like terrifying between New York City or whatever it was like you'd start

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
with pizza right. You'd go to selfie rather than Maybe it's like rat riding a motorcycle then maybe it's like rat

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
president like like they there is a progression of like complexity that makes

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
sense because the other thing that I think about is like why would a

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
rat holes a pizza like. And the pizza was like perfect like it wasn't like a

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
crumpled up thing that been on the floor like the way I remember it was like a slice that had been purchased by the rat.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
So you see it's like making you

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
question what what is real Yeah. Now I do feel like a little bit of a rat

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.000
truth

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
or right. I mean my first impulse when I found out the piece or it might be a hoax. Was just to

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
be mad because I felt like this one incredible moment where the

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
universe distilled everything New York City into this encounter with a rat on the subway was

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
a lie. But then I started thinking like who is the liar in this

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
situation and it seems like it's this

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
person

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
who is looking down over the

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
city and basically leading us through mazes to get a

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
reward just just delivering a little joy. To our rat like lives right. A

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
world where a rat carries a slice of pizza is more interesting than or doesn't but a world where a

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
lady trained a lab rat who cares abuse is more interesting than either of those worlds.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Yes it is such an attractive

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
idea. So attractive in fact that I proposed it to Matt little the guy from the Peter

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
had video and even he was willing to entertain a.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
How do you know that you weren't an unwitting pawn in some kind of massive Zar

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
do Luzhin or micros or delusion. Well that's an

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
interesting question I think

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
that I think that one could never

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
know you can really you can really go down like a pretty serious

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
rabbit hole with this discussion or use or do I would if yours are two of you have to tell me it's

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
the law or it's like it's like if I'm a cop Yeah yeah I do and you're trying to sell me cigarettes.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Yeah I would love to Beezer do it because I would love to have like a vision like this but right. I'm not. Yeah.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:41.000
So

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
after this government article comes out everyone in New York City is talking about viral read video again

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
including a woman named Laura dude.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
It was in my head I think like just because that morning I had read something

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
online about how pizza route was a hoax and it was such a big

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
bummer this rat is you know just want to freakin slice of pizza

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
and it's going to do anything to get it it was just kind of like embodied the New York

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
spirit so Laura's coming home from dinner thinking about pizza rat and she

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
goes into the thirty four St Herald Square subway stop.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
I was walking on the stairs and I noticed something moving by my feet when she gets to the bottom of the

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
stairs she pulls out her

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
phone and this time instead of a rat pulling a piece of pizza

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
down the stairs. It's two rats valiantly pulling a piece of pita bread

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
up the stairs. I'm not looking to have a viral video I never was. But I

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
just thought that I could not not film

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
that it's hard to deny that the timing of this video is pretty weird because the

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Gothamist article that Pete threatened selfie rat came out just the week before but I talked to Laura for about

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
an hour and she was certain that her do had nothing to do with what she'd seen that there was no

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
conspiracy that rats just like the

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
PETA PETA rats are not these are just real rats. I mean

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
I know. No I have no proof that I'm not lying but.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
I never thought that I would have to to back up

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
my story ever. Oh I don't think that you're lying. I guess what I'm I guess what I'm asking

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000
is considering how well coordinated those two rats were pulling that Pete up the stairs.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Could you entertain the possibility even for a second that there might have been some rat

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
trainer hiding somewhere in the subway.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
I mean I guess I could admit that. There's you know a brigade

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
of trained rats have been released upon New York City now that you've told me all of this background information.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
How do I know

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
how do I know any rat is not one of the bizarre do lose rats. I mean I guess they could have been

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.000
planted

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
there at one point during my interview with Laura my producer Tim stepped in and asked a couple

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
questions for his Herald

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Square very close.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Really. Yeah. It's thirty fourth and

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
sixth and U.C.B. is twenty six

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
minutes but that doesn't mean

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
anything that's just coincidence.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Well I'm just trying to figure out what they are

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
do if there was somebody unusual. I wonder if there's

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:19.000
something unusual the top of the stairs. But you didn't you wouldn't you would imagine if you saw some odd one.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
If

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
you saw someone with a cage. Yeah to measure

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
what.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
There was a there was a guy at the top of the stairs.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
I assumed he was a homeless person he was kind of

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
shouting nonsensical

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
things you know yelling about being hungry and are you hungry and it does look like

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
he's tossing like some kind of item

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
at the Rat I don't know if it's a crumb of something or a piece of

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
something and then it. I don't film anymore after that but it is if you have

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
a couple seconds of that I don't know if

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
he's involved. I just. I don't even

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
I really didn't think that I didn't give him much thought as someone who could have been

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
like working in the background to facilitate

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:18.000
this

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
more said that there was also a woman standing near her at the bottom of the stairs who was asking people not to get

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
too close so Laura could

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
film since they got

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
a missed article came out Sardou Lou has declined numerous interviews including

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
a request from

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
me but once her name was public she did two

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
things First she started a Twitter account and a Facebook

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000
account and second she issued a statement which is totally amazing.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
She said quote I think there are better stories to tell. Why wake

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
the world from a beautiful dream when the waking world is also

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
drab

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Why wake the world from a beautiful dream when the waking world is also

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
drab What was her avatar like oh I would I would be delighted

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
to show us.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Oh my God Oh my

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
God Yeah that's our do. OK I'll try as

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
private her seems like a woman she's wearing a

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
purple robe as a sorcerer would she's she's

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
got some kind of like it's not like a turban.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
It's like a turban and like a magician's hat like jammed together but her face is covered

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
in this

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
like what looks like a death mask for like man or billy

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
goat and then she has pink hair behind that and has a very like it's a creepy

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
like otherworldly like kind of menacing goofiness and then she's

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
holding a golden staff of a rat eating its own tail like a

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
rigorous right

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Alex.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Very enjoy of all this whole creepy thing.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
So these are do lose social media presence. If I could borrow a phrase

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
from Eric your Would is just basically a bunch

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
of enigmatic head scratchers OK Her tweets are written in the

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
voice of someone who is like. All powerful and all know what is

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
a type of person. Reply here a couple of her tweets follow me out of the

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
sunlight of reason and then the darkness will play.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
OK I have no memories of my actual life. I can only recall what was captured

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
and replayed in digital images.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Wow.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Sam what did she mean I think

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
what she means I think her whole sort of world view is that the media

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
create myths like you and I we make a radio show or we have narratives

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
our narratives are tightly controlled by us and our editing process

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
so we are mythmakers. Her and

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
so she exists just to manipulate us and make her own myth.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
So she's really into Sasquatch and the like Ness Monster because

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
those were the effort of a lot of people to try and fool a lot of other people into

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
believing something that was kind of magical or

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
supernatural right and also those are myths that

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
weren't created by you know the CIA or N.B.C. like they were created

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
by

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
people who like will never now and in fact our Twitter handle is I

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.000
am the

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
mythmaker

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
feels like if your enemy the myth maker maybe should tell you really are the member here.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000
So since she has a social media present tried getting in touch with her.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Normally when I ask for interviews I say like hi my name is Alex Goldman I work on this project

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
called reply all. And we have X. listeners and I think your story would be good on our show for.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Reasons but with or

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000
do I I just like I just went totally off script.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
I mean here's something that I actually wrote in an email to her. This is not I mean I'm

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
quoting right now. It says you've successfully cracked my brain wide open. So

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
congratulations to you on

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
that your very existence has basically made me open to believing that anything is

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
real and simultaneously that

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
anything is an illusion. I mean I was offering to do an interview where she sat behind a screen so that I

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
couldn't see her not just hold the microphone just be on the screen. I was writing these messages that

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
said knowing that she exists didn't make the waking world more drab it actually made it more amazing

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
because it made it like more unpredictable

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
and I was telling her that learning her existence totally changed the way that I saw the

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
world and she eventually declined to do an interview by not really responding to me

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
anymore but she did say at one point.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Be assured that the breadth and magnitude of my work would astound you.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Was

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000
it true what you said that it was making you see the world differently see the city differently.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Yes I have put my phone down and I watched people.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
And I am suspect of

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
everyone I know I'm I like that this is happening to you I'm

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000
moderately skeptical like you think everybody can be part of a star do little hoax.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Have you noticed at the Carroll Street stop there was a woman who is very well dressed in like

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
a cloak who's constantly asking for spare change. Now she exists She's

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:39.000
tall and

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
thin. And very very impeccably dressed

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
and stands at the entrance of the subway asking for spare change every day in an

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
impeccable cloak. Yes.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Ha. It's like there are tiny things that I've been noticing. Give me another arm.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
I was on the subway the other day and there were. A couple dancing with one

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
another no music just dancing like slow

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
dancing fast dancing slow dancing.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
It felt like a slow dance at the

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
prom old couple young couple middle

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
age have already or fifty. It's like all of the

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
sudden everything could be said to him.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
That's so funny and Eric who if you remember is the only person who admitted to me that he's made her

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:27.000
do

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
it he makes it sound like there's almost nothing she can't do.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
It's a good thing that they're doing is using her powers for good because if she were to use

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
her powers for evil that wouldn't be good. Can you can

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
you give me a doomsday scenario imagine her using her powers for evil. What would she be doing.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Well a doomsday scenario would be that is are do

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
little is using her abilities to

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
create myths to completely

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
disorient our federal

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
government. All of our

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
say the utilities in the city all of

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
our metropolitan

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
infrastructure mass hysteria. People's lives being up

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
ended just panic in the streets. I think that these are due Lou

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
could cause just completely

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Armageddon just of have to do because I can like

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
convince people to blog about something that seems fantastic too. I can convince world leaders to

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
do things is like in my mind actually a pretty large

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
jump. He thinks that he saw

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
things that were much larger in scope than

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
rat tricks like what like a like a like a robot of President Obama that was completely

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
lifelike I don't know man maybe that bodysuit of human hair. Who knows what's going to be that's

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
going to be used for maybe she's going to be a sasquatch.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Next

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
God. OK But so even then you're like Justin Trudeau you're

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
walking down the street in Montreal thinking about like what Canada's monetary policy should be and like

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
a really life like Sasquatch chums out of an alleyway It's

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.000
like raise interest rates and disappears. I don't think you're going to listen that advice.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
OK.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Here's what I say if I were Justin

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Trudeau Britannica all of my Alex gold many traits.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Yeah you'd be a very handsome Alice Goldman who could speak French.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
But if I were to retain sort of like my terrible personality my weak

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
shriveled posture. All of the things that make me essentially Alex

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Goldman and a Sasquatch friend

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
and told me to raise interest rates.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
You better believe not only would I be raising interest rates. I would be putting all of

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
my national defense money into Sasquatch

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
elimination. Why do you have to the Sasquatch is out to get

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
you. Because the way that you described it was like a crowd going terrifying. You know if that's true

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.000
that's fair.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
I mean I know that certain Lou probably can't actually cause Armageddon. But her

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
very existence has definitely made my life way more unpredictable. And I'm just kind

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
of waiting for the moment that she strikes again.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
So

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
if you're out there listening to this.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
I want you to know that I take the effort train between thirty fourth Street and Carroll Street every

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
morning between nine and ten and most nights between five and six.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:45.000
I'll be looking for

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:59.000
you.

service and your staff fact of the week. Well it's really more of a message factor that the message back to

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
the week is the existence of carrier pigeons. I know that carrier pigeons exist yet but there are

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
famous carrier

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
pigeons the most famous carrier pigeon was named Sharon me and she helped save a lot of

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Italian during World War one where he really helped save the Taliban. Yeah. Over five hundred soldiers were trapped behind

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
German lines. They sent Cherami with a message that said many wounded. We cannot

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
evacuate and the Germans shot her and she still got the message

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
across and after she returned home. Jeremy was awarded with the quad to Gary Medel

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
and she also received a gold medal from the organized bodies of American racing pigeon fanciers

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:03.000
and

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000

and learn about what goes on on the

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Internet Alex comes to us with tweets that he doesn't understand and.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Hopefully we can decipher

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
them for him and I'm really I'm really excited. This is like

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
one super mystifying tweet like I'm baffled like zero percent comprehension

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
zero percent comprehension. OK All right you guys ready.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Yes I'm excited. I'm really hoping you can help me out alright. It's actually comes from a listener.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Alex press love who tweeted at me and said ideal yes yes no

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
material and Alex I have to agree I believe this is ideal. Yes yes no material

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
he included a link to this tweet in his tweet the tweet in question

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
is from a Twitter user

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
named Kate's Kama latte birdie

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
and the Photo Shopped poster of like sort of like some sort of town hall and it

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
says Bernie or Hillary be informed compare them on issues that matter has got

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
their two pictures and

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
then and then it says issue and then here's where the photoshopping begins.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Wherever whatever the issue that was there before.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
It's been boxed out and now there's a new thing written in which is it.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
To near zero point five

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
X. a presses and then under

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Bernie's picture where it had a quote that sort of like represented how he felt about that issue.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Now it says quote. First off I need to talk about parallel universes.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
And then under Hillary's picture where the new quote has been photo shopped and it

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
says quote and a press isn't a press.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000
You can't say it's only half so that's totally fucking confusing. Yeah I have no

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
idea what that is I don't know what point five X. a press's means I don't know what they're talking

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
about but here's the weird thing in this

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
tweet. They got one thousand two hundred nine read

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
tweets and I got one thousand six hundred two likes. That's insane.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
And then Kate latte birdy

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
said I ran out of the shower to make this because I was so proud of

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
it all right so that's I am complete the

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
I'm confused by this one yeah. Peach of a do you do you understand the street like fifty

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000
percent comprehension. Scope and do you understand the tweet. I understand the joke format.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
You don't understand why content that is contained therein.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Alex Blumberg you understand this but

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
no I think we can get you to like I don't think we can get you all the way on this one we can get you to

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
like huh. OK OK. I was going to really have to detective this now aren't

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
we hash at OK OK So the the basic thing that

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
like job for one thing that Alzheimer with understand is

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
like there's this me I don't actually know or the mean like I don't know

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
what Basically there's this poster as you can see where

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:40.000
it's

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
comparing Bernie and Hillary on like any specific campaign issue. And there's like a call back from having a

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
crowbar from her right and the joke that kind of keeps cropping up over and over and over

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
again which like there's a lot of talk around whether the joke is

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
OK or not but the joke

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
is that whatever the issue is. Bernie's answer will

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
always be very long kind of like want cash like perhaps like more detail than is

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
necessary and then Hillary's answer will always be like kind

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
of vapid and straightforward and like wrong but

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
enthusiastic Got it

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
OK and feel like people like the joke because it's versatile and you can apply I think

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
any weird specific subculture issues like imagine if the candidate had an opinion about

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
whatever says OK but some people don't like the joke because they're like it's just

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:31.000
straightforwardly sexist

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000
because Hillary Clinton isn't somebody who like has super vassal opinions about stuff but I don't know exist

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
and I just I think a Texas and a just out of got you all right so wait. So

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000
can you give me some examples of the joke the way and in a form that we would understand it. OK so from the

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Slate article about like why this is maybe

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
problematic. Here's here's like the best example I've ever seen actually so issue.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Harry Potter. Ernie side. Huge fan read all

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
the books know all the trivia about Hillary doesn't even know what a muggle

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
is and then Hillary says I'm a hostile

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
pompe when really that house would be

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000
hopeful pop. Hopeful hopeful. What is it half a puff hustled off.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
It's now that I messed up that you knew to go to me with that is even more messed up the knew the answer I haven't

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
read it.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000
I

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
still read the I.M.D.B. trivia section for every movie I've ever seen so I just know all the

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
trivia for you other than the movie you know possible I'm a hostile awful

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
FOV hostile PAF just to have a bob and it's awful

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
pomp Aleksey really like the sexist age of job you are even

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
OK here's what I think is real and actually this one is going to make sense

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000
because it has like a

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
nother imbedded Yes yes no problem in it I

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:54.000
think which is why and so issue white vans semi idea.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Yeah no away fans thing.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
You sound like you just saw a war crime happen. I hate that don't you really.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Oh you're broke

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000
and OK so the issue white vans Hillary don't get in strangers cars kids.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Bernie damn Daniel like.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
How do you choke. It's just stupid. You're so broke and OK that wintery

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
OK So that was a twofer. Somebody posted this video

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
as kind of a true video. It's like it's so wonderful but in ways they're like actually kind of

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
hard to put into words early so I can tell you've seen it. OK so.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Oh my God it makes me so happy to show you this.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000
There's like so few things that are any good and this is so good. OK so all it is is a

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Twitter video that wine high school kid shot it's like a montage of a bunch of

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
different shots of his friend and just like in case you are just hearing this and can't see the video. It's

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
basically a bunch of like tight jump cuts of this one kid who is wearing a bunch of different really

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
great outfits

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
and you can't see the person filming him but you hear him reacting to all of

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
them and

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
you get it again with the Wanted

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Dead genuine and

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
genuine and then you know

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Jack Daniel's back at it again with

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
the light that

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
and the now and

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:28.000
now.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.000
So

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
it's oh so than than this

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
the bring your Hilary. Issue white vans Bernie

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Dam Danielle get set and then Hillary don't get a stranger's cars kids like she

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
thinks which is like a white van got it.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Yeah. Got it. I guess not so much a great joke as two internet

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
jokes hitting each other and people being excited about it right. OK So there's a bunch of these Bernie

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
or Hillary Photoshop posters.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Yeah OK Got it. So then back to the. Issue at hand actually

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
issued hand. Which. What was it again. Zero point five eight

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
presses their point five X. a presses. First off I need to talk about parallel

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
universes are eight. I've been looking it up. Well we've been talking and they press isn't a press. You can't say

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:15.000
it's only

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
half you look like you're processing information. This is so confusing. It

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:26.000
has something to do with Super Mario sixty four really. Yes what.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
This guy made a long and complicated video about completing this stage in Super

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Mario sixty four using only zero point five A presses

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
says impossible.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Yes So the A button makes you jump. You can't do head. You can't press a half a

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
button when you press the button is pressed was it like a speed round.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
No it's a long and complicated video about completing a stage using only zero point five eight presses.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
It's ridiculous and amazing but at one point he responds to a comment by T.J. Henry

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Yoshi who claims that zero point five eight presses aren't real because you can't have pressed the button.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
The poster of the video then took some time to explain how is your point five après is a real and

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
exactly how they work the overall ridiculous of the video has caused it to become an internet me

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
and Henry is of course part of it.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Wow you can spend your life any way you want and it was her chosen. No

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
this is what they've chosen we make sense. OK So this is a person

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
who found a way to

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000
beat Super Mario sixty four a video game from no

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000
one thousand nine hundred six maybe a level in Super Mario sixty four a video game from yeah maybe

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
ninety six so. So a person who be a very old videogame and they did it by putting

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
an artificial encumbrance on cells was that they would only press the jump

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000
button half the

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
time which again means

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
that you have press a button. Well let's

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
hear what you know for game run use around it down to two. So in

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
conclusion

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
since that first the press counts in some kind. But at no additional a

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
precedent other

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000
contacts I'm familiar refer to it the press going back to

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
the video you can only right now if you know you so well

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
you're right you're right if I can you get it. No it's not that crazy people

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
are deliberately misunderstand I get him.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Yeah I don't know what Super Mario is and I've never played it before but like it just sounds like he's

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000
saying like when you're in one of the press the button down and they don't release the button in tell me it's

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000
over and there was a little next level so until the next thought was over where you would like and then you

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
removed half and then you press.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Oh so you spread it you spread your a button press across multiple levels.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Yeah it's like don't ever let it up this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
heard like the guy sounds like a putz. That's rude. I'm

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
sorry the people that you have probably read on the Internet Yoshi Henry

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000
like your mouthy guy for doing speed right. You'd be one of the people who would like it had

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
you known about this you have been

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:06.000
like this is the the half press to say I believe I would agree with Hillary on.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Oh there's no such thing as I have breasts but like it just makes me want to shoot high school because

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000
like you're yelling at the nerds you're mean to the kids who are just

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:21.000
like goofy fashion kids like you don't like anything. I was very very lonely in high school.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000
I did mean to such a dark place called and I think we're not celebrating

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
our victorious arrival yes yes yes properly. Are we yes it's like we are like I

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
think we are yes yes no yes are you ready. Yes All right so Kate

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
latte birdie sent out the following tweet it's a picture of Bernie or

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Hillary sign.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Where it's like be informed compare them on the issues that matter and then there is an

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
issue colon and then it's clearly something has been superimposed over the original issue that was

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000
on the original poster and the superimposed issue is zero point five

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
times a presses and then under Bernie.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
His real answer has. And so to shut out and the rich and the fake answer is. First off I need to

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
talk about parallel universes and under Hillary. It says and they press isn't a press. You

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
can't say it's only half.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
I now know everything about this this this thing that was like I

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
really mystifying is now completely clear to me. All right. And there's a lot of me this is the

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
deep this is the most complicated one I think we've done so it was like a Third there is so much going on here so all

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:26.000
right

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
so there's two memes that are sort of intersecting here. The first mean is one that I did not aware of which

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
was the Photoshop Bernie or Hillary sign.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
So that's like something that's happening on the Internet a lot of people are taking this original Bernie or Hillary sign

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
which some well meaning group put up to inform people on the issues of how different the two candidates

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
were and has simply just been sort of like ridiculed on the Internet by people putting up fake issues

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
and fake answers to Bernie and Hillary. All right so that's been out

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000
there and then this particular iteration of

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
that ME him references another ME him which gets

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
deep into the stodgy a video game affinity

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
groups right. Yeah there's lots and lots of people who play old video game

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
called Super Mario sixty

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
four correct. Yes and they talk about on the Internet about how to

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
beat different levels of Super Mario sixty four and this one guy talked about

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:25.000
beating this one level by doing a half press of the a key.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Called a bug called about and yeah that's close to half press of the A button. Which

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000
erupted in controversy and that is the thing that is referenced in this tweet

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
from Kate left a birdie. It is as

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
if Hillary and Bernie were weighing in on the issue of whether there

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000
is such a thing as a half a press in the Super Mario sixty four video game.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
I feel like we're pretty much yes yes yes. What's your asterisk Bernie saying

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
First we have to talk about purely OK we're basically yes yes

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
yes yes I don't know what that's about but I just yeah we can let that one go. In

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
the interest of full disclosure we did not watch the entire half hour video so who knows it might be a mission.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Well clearly you know what I have our own zero sixty four video. Exactly but

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
we like we can retreat from this thing called the S.S. as right.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Yes yes

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000
yes reply all is P.J.

Can I tell you guys a weird story. One time I was in the grocery store.

I was checking

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000
out and the guy in front of me.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Had tattooed on his arm his very muscular head tattooed on his arm.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000
The Great Gazoo who is a mark who is like an alien from the Jetsons.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:42.000
And the Flintstones. Oh no excuse me. Thank you who's an alien from The Flintstones.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000
And he was flirting with the woman who was checking him out

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000
and he was like What do you know about the Great Gazoo.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000
This is a good elsewhere you know she was like what and he's like who is

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000

Martian and he was like you don't know anything about the great kids

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.000

man is also like sort of similar to

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.000
you were like oh wow I just like this because of cultures really important.
